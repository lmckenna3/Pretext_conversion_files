        Earth is currently in its sixth period of profound continental glaciation,
        the Quaternary Ice Age.

        This Ice Age is marked by periodic growth and then retreat of ice sheets across continents of the northern hemisphere.
        This cyclic pattern is initiated by periodic variations in Earth's orbit,
        which change the insolation incident on the polar areas of the northern hemisphere.
        These Milankovich cycles are due to the gravitational effects of other planets on Earth's orbit.

        Positive feed backs between ice cover, albedo,
        ocean temperature and atmospheric <m>CO_2</m> deepen the severity of stadials,
        and contribute to their termination as well.

      <p>
        The most recent glacial period ended roughly 20 kya;
        our current inter-stadial period is long by recent standards,
        but it is very unlikely a new stadial will begin within the next 50-100 kyr.
        A new glacial cycle will not save human societies from global warming.
