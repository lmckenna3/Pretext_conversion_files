      <title>Introduction: Normal now is generally not normal then</title>
      <p>
        Having examined the long-term evolution of the atmosphere in Chapter 6, you should not be surprised to discover that the composition of the oceans also changes over time.
        Our conception of ''normal'' oceans just isn't applicable to most of the ocean's history!
        But before we examine those changes,
        we need a firm foundation of the current composition and state of the world's oceans.

      <title>Water and
      <q>salts</q>
      </title>
      <p>
        Put as simply as possible,
        the oceans are 96.8% water and 3.2% dissolved solids,
        or ''salts.'' The salinity
        (or total concentration of dissolved solids)
        of a volume of sea water is one of two factors that control the behavior of sea water.
        Together with temperature, salinity determines sea water's density,
        and hence how the oceans transport both mass and energy across Earth. \paragraphs{Salts and salinity} While salinity and temperature both vary widely through the oceans,
        the actual composition of the dissolved solids is surprisingly invariable<fn>

        This observation has profound implications:
        most of the dissolved solids are thoroughly mixed during their residence in the oceans.
        These
        <q>conserved</q>
        elements take little or no part in the biological processes in the oceans,
        and so make great indicators of processes affecting the oceans.
        <xref ref="tab_salinity">Table</xref>
        indicates that the components of table salt,
        sodium (<m>Na^+</m>) and chlorine (<m>Cl^-</m>) ions make up the vast majority of the dissolved solids in sea water,
        but sulphate ions (<m>SO_4^{2-}</m>) and three cations common in rocks (<m>Mg^+,\ Ca^+,\ and\ K^+,\</m>) are abundant as well.
        We are so accustomed to thinking that salt water has <em>only</em>
        sodium chloride dissolved in it that you might find the data in <xref ref="tab_salinity">Table</xref> unsurprising.
        But everything on
        (and not on)
        table <em>should</em> surprise you!
        The composition of seawater is the result of a dynamic balance,
        or steady state,
        between sources and sinks of dissolved material to the oceans.
        Surrounded above by the atmosphere, below by the sea floor,
        and to the sides by the continents and their rivers,
        the oceans' composition is the product of the interactions between all of Earth's sphere.
        Even, recently, the Anthroposphere
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important source of solids to the oceans is rivers.
        Aristotle postulated in 350 BCE that rivers were the ultimate source of dissolved solids to the sea,
        and successive generations of scientists have quantified that contribution,
        including Urey.
        We saw in the Urey reaction ( <xref ref="eq_urey"></xref>,
        <xref ref="eq_urey">page</xref>) that weathering of rocks produced calcium (<m>Ca^{2+}</m>),
        silica (<m>SiO_2</m>) and bicarbonate ions (<m>CO_3^-</m>) which are washed in to rivers by rain,
        and then to the oceans by rivers.
        Weathering also produces the sodium (<m>Na^+</m>) and the three cations (<m>Mg^+,\ Ca^+,\ and\ K^+,\</m>),
        which commonly substitute for Ca in minerals and rocks.
        If rivers were the only source of salts to the oceans,
        we'd expect that the relative proportions of ions in rivers and sea water would be the same.
        As shown in <xref ref="tab_river_ocean_comp">table</xref>
        and <xref ref="fig_or_ions">Figure</xref> this is clearly not so.
        Rivers alone cannot be the only source of ions to the oceans,
        as rivers have distinctly different relative concentrations of ions than seawater does.
      </p>
      <p>
        The absence of silica and bicarbonate in seawater is easily explained:
        the biosphere effectively removes the silica (<m>SiO_2</m>),
        bicarbonate ions (<m>CO_3^-</m>) and (<m>Ca^{2+}</m>) produced by weathering from the oceans.
        All three compounds are used by organisms as the framework for their shells.
        Once the organisms die,
        much of this skeletal material falls to the ocean floor as marine sediments,
        and eventually sedimentary rock.

        And that just leaves the chloride ion (<m>Cl^-</m>),
        only the most abundant of the ions, to explain.
        Chloride is a large,
        negatively charged ion that fits poorly in the structure of minerals and rocks.
        It dissolves readily in water and other fluids,
        and being volatile is easily lost from magma.
        Because of this,
        <m>Cl^-</m> is continually concentrated into Earth's crust and oceans.
        To fully understand how, we need to turn to the geosphere,
        and in particular to volcanic rocks at mid-ocean ridges along divergent plate boundaries
        (red lines on <xref ref="fig_global_bathy">Figure</xref>).
        The most spectacular display of this interaction are the occasional hydrothermal vents
        (<xref ref="fig_smokers">Figure</xref>)
        which pepper the ridges.
        Discovered only in 1977<fn>

        </fn>,
        the plumes of super-heated,
        mineral-rich water are the result cold seawater infiltrating hot,
        newly-formed volcanic rocks along the mid-ocean ridge.
        The newly heated seawater reacts with the rocks, losing calcium,
        sulphate,
        magnesium and chloride to the rocks,
        while picking up iron, manganese, copper, zinc and sulfur.
        Once these altered rocks arrive at subduction zones,
        much of the chloride is returned to the oceans through melting and volcanism,
        complete the chloride cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The connection between seawater salinity and the composition of the geosphere is a spectacular example of interactions between the spheres acting as a buffer to rapid environmental changes.
        In effect, the ocean floor acts as a planet-sized pump,
        drawing seawater of one composition and temperature and ejecting seawater of a different composition and temperature.
        The initial chemical composition of the pump<mdash/>the volcanic rocks of the seafloor<mdash/>is for the most part fixed by Earth's internal composition,
        so the net effect of the pump is to stabilize the sea's composition over time.
        The pump is surprisingly efficient,
        with the entire volume of the oceans passing though the sea floor in about \SI{4}{\ma}<fn>

      <title>Introduction: Bathymetry of ocean floor</title>
      <p>
        The first accurate maps of the ocean floors were painstakingly assembled by Marie Tharp,
        a geologist and mathematician who laboriously assembled data collected by others
        (at the time,
        women were not allowed on oceanographic research vessels)
        to create the first global maps of the ocean floor in 1977.
        The maps, painted by hand with a beautiful but exaggerated perspective,
        were so popular they were featured in popular magazines,
        and remain today some of the more beautiful maps ever created<fn>
        Hall, Stephen S. "The Contrary Map Maker." New York: Times Magazine, December 31 (2006): 45-47.
        Her maps are available as overlays on Google's
        <q>Earth</q>
        application.
        </fn>.
        More modern maps
        (<xref ref="fig_global_bathy">Figure</xref>)
        lack the artistic beauty of Tharp's map,
        but show additional detail that reveals the dynamic forces shaping the sea floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sea floor reveled by <xref ref="fig_global_bathy">Figure</xref> seems counter-intuitive,
        until you recall that plate tectonics is the primary force shaping our planet.
        These details are shown in <xref ref="fig_bathy_detail">Figures</xref>
        and <xref ref="fig_hypso"></xref>.
        In the central portions of most ocean basins are shallow,
        narrow and world-circling mountain ranges.
        These Mid-ocean ridges are the sites of constructive plate boundaries,
        where new oceanic crust forms from melting of Earth's mantle.
        This young, hot,
        and relatively less dense crust floats high in the mantle,
        making shallow ridges.
        As this new crust cools and grows denser,
        the ocean floor sinks, forming the deep ocean basins.
        Sea floor far from its natal ridge is oldest, coolest and densest,
        hence the deepest parts of the ocean floor-the abyssal plains-are nearest the continents!
        In a few places,
        deep oceanic trenches mark destructive plates boundaries,
        where plates dive back into the mantle,
        to be melted and eventually recycled at the mid-ocean ridges.
        Gigantic submarine plateaus,
        shallow parts of the sea floor formed from massive outpourings of melted mantle,
        cover 5% of the ocean floor the ocean floor,
        particularly in the western Pacific basin<fn>

        Although they are submerged beneath the oceans, the broad,
        shallow continental shelves are actually parts of the continents.
        Stretching in some cases for hundreds of kilometers from the current coastlines,
        the shelves are amongst the most biologically productive parts of the oceans.

      <title>Salinity</title>
      <p>
        In Chapter 6 we saw that atmospheric circulation and particularly the difference between evaporation and precipitation over the oceans controlled the salinity of the surface oceans.
        <xref ref="fig_surf_salinity">Figure</xref>
        shows that salinities are highest below the large atmospheric high pressure systems near latitudes of <m>25 \deg</m> N and S, where evaporation is greater than precipitation.<fn>

        </fn>These pools of high salinity are visible within the first few hundreds of meters in the oceans.
      </p>
      <p>
        The large horizontal variations in salinity hides a far more uniform picture at depth.
        Thanks to research stretching over a century,
        we have a reasonable idea of the variation of salinity with depth,
        as shown in <xref ref="fig_Salinity_section">Figure</xref> for the Atlantic Ocean.
        The extraordinary homogeneity of the deep oceans' salinity is illustrated by the tiny variation in salinity below a few hundred meters depth.
        This lack of variation is due to the conserved nature of both <m>Na^+</m> and <m>Cl^-</m> ions.
        No organism consumes or emits these ions,
        and there are few non-biologic sources or sinks for them in the deep ocean.
        So their concentration changes only through mixing of water with initially different salinities.
        But this mixing averages out the salinity differences,
        leading to the interior heterogeneity seen in the figure.

        </fn> compiled all the then-available data on salinity in the deep oceans and inferred that the vast majority of the oceans have salinities in the exceptionally narrow range of <m>34.75\pm 0.25</m> \textperthousand.
        The interiors of the oceans are surprisingly uniform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to both natural processes and man-made pollution,
        the salinity of Earth's oceans is very slowly increasing.
        The anthropogenic component of salinity entering the oceans is now about 40%<fn>

      <title>Temperature</title>
      <p>
        As we noted in <xref ref="water_emp">section</xref>,
        water has a high heat capacity,
        which means water must absorb or emit significant heat in order to change temperature.
        Sunlight (or air warmed by sunlight) is essentially the only source of heat to the oceans,
        so as you might expect the ocean surface is warmest at the equator.
        In the polar regions, where sunlight is weak and the air cold,
        water loses heat to the atmosphere and so is coldest at the poles.
        <xref ref="fig_zonal_sst">Figure</xref>
        shows that our first-order hypothesis is good.
        Annual average sea surface temperatures fall below \SI{0}{\celsius} poleward of <m>60 \deg</m> latitude (sea water,

        A global map

        of sea surface temperatures
        (universally called
        <q>SST</q>),
        shows abundant details to explore.
        The dominant cold-warm-cold variation from pole to equator to pole is quite evident.
        The equatorial western Pacific and Indian Oceans together form an enormous
        <q>pool</q>
        of warm water stretching a third the way around the globe.
        In the eastern Pacific,
        a thin band of cold water along the equator is the source of the equatorial

        seen in <xref ref="fig_zonal_sst">Figure</xref>.
        Both of these features are the result of circulation of surface waters,
        which we'll examine in detail below.
        Other features in the SST map are obscured by the pole-to-pole variation.
        We will frequently want to visualize and discuss <em>differences</em>
        between average and actual values,
        rather than the actual values themselves.
        In this case, removing the zonal average at every latitude
        (displayed in <xref ref="fig_zonal_sst">Figure</xref>)
        from every point in the SST map gives <xref ref="fig_sst_map">Figure</xref>

        Areas that are colder than average for the their latitude are colored blue,
        and warmer areas in brown, as shown by the scale.
        Clearly present is an east-west dichotomy in all the oceans:
        eastern portions are cooler than the western portions.
        Although most strongly developed in the Pacific Ocean,

        <q>plumes</q>
        of cold SST on the <em>western</em>edges of the continents is quite striking in the Americas, Africa and even Australia.
        As we'll see below,
        this is due to the upwelling of cold water from the deep ocean to the surface along the eastern edges of the oceans,
        and then their transport by surface currents toward the equator.
        The other striking feature on the difference map is in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean,
        where a narrow stream of relatively hot water forms near Florida,
        then snakes along the eastern continental edge of North America,
        finally spreading out into the seas off of Europe.
        This is the Gulf Stream,
        and forms an essential parts of one of the most important pacemakers of Earth's climate,
        the Meridional Overturning Circulation.
        All of these circulation systems,
        which clearly cause the movement of warm and cool ocean masses,
        transport heat from Equator to pole,
        a process we'll examine in detail below.

      <title>pH, acidity and saturation states</title>
      <p>
        The acidity of a solution is measured by the
        <em>pH</em>, a short-hand for the
        <q>power of Hydrogen.</q>
        Neutral solutions
        (think pure water)
        have a <m>pH=7</m>, acidic solutions
        (think black coffee)
        have <m>pH\lt 7</m>, while alkaline solutions
        (think soapy water)
        have <m>pH>7</m>.
        The pH scale,
        like so many other tools used in this book, is a logarithmic.
        A decreases of just 0.1 pH unit indicates a 25% increase in acidity.
        The pH of the contemporary shallow ocean varies regionally and seasonally from 7.9 to 8.2 pH units<fn>

        making it slightly alkaline.
        In general, places with less light
        (the winter-time pole and the deep ocean)
        have <em>lower</em> pH, because of their lower biological productivity.
        Actually, we don't much care about the contemporary pH distribution on the oceans
        (<xref ref="fig_ph_map">Figure</xref>)
        as much as we care about its change over time.
        Prior to industrialization, oceans had an average pH of roughly 8.25;
        contemporary oceans have a pH closer to 8.14,
        an acidity increase of nearly 30%.

        that's what the oceans look like to the atmosphere.

        Once in the oceans,
        that <m>CO_2</m> reacts with water in a series of steps to form a weak acid,
        a process we saw way back in <xref ref="eq_carbonic">Equations</xref>.
        The increasing acidity of the oceans is just one more side effect of <m>CO_2</m> emissions.
        But another of the reactions between <m>CO_2</m> and sea water is both more surprising and more disturbing.
        Coral reefs are the best known examples,
        but many marine creatures beside those making spectacular reefs build shells from the mineral aragonite{footnote{McCulloch, M. T., D'Olivo, J. P., Falter, J., Holcomb, M., &amp; Trotter, J. A. (2017).

        (both liberated from the weathering or rocks on the continents,
        see <xref ref="eq_urey">the</xref>
        equation in <xref ref="swrwl">Section</xref>)
        dissolved in the oceans:

          <mrow xml:id="eq_caco3" number="yes">HCO_3^{1-} \amp  + \amp  Ca^{2+} \rightleftharpoons \amp  CaCO_3 + \amp  H_2O + \amp  CO_2</mrow>

        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the materials on the right hand side are found in sea water:
        that <m>CO_2</m> is gas dissolved in the oceans.
        Unlike many of the reactions you may have seen in Chemistry or Biology classes,
        <xref ref="eq_caco3">equation</xref> goes both ways,
        that is the equation runs both direction, as indicated by the
        <q>double ended harpoon</q>
        symbol (<m>\rightleftharpoons</m>) in the equation.
        As the big wet sponge of the ocean soaks up <m>CO_2</m> from the atmosphere,
        <xref ref="eq_caco3">equation</xref> runs to the <em>left</em>:
        water and dissolved <m>CO_2</m> spontaneously combine with the shells of marine organisms
        (living or dead)
        and return to dissolved calcium and bicarbonate ions.
        Increasing ocean acidity is decreasing the chemical stability of a vast array of marine creatures,
        from the spectacular corals of the Great Barrier Reef to the more mundane but equally important aragonite muds formed from broken-down shells.
        The relative stability of aragonite shells in sea water is given by the
        <q>saturation index,</q>
        which must be greater than 2.9 for aragonite to remain solid and not dissolve back in to sea water.
        As shown in Figure , this condition is already present in some of the colder parts of the oceans;
        recent research unfortunately suggests that the mundane muds making up much of coral reefs may begin dissolving back into the increasingly acidic oceans by 2050-2080 CE.

        Across the world,
        the ocean's pH and aragonate saturation index are decreasing<fn>
        Takahashi, et al., op cit.
        </fn>.
        The best evidence for these decreases comes from research sites in the oceans repeatedly occupied by ships or buoys.
        Three of these records are shown in <xref ref="fig_oa">Figure</xref>
        (Note that the graphs for the Canary Islands and Bermuda are displaced 0.15 and 0.30 units downward for clarity).
        All three stations show natural annual cycles superimposed on a gradual but obvious long-term decrease.
        At each of the stations,
        pH is changing by <m>-0.02</m> pH units per decade,
        or roughly a 7% increase in acidity every 10 years.
        Aragonite saturation states have also decreased,
        at about 0.08 units per decade.

      <title>Light</title>
      <p>
        We denizens of Earth's surface take light for granted.
        Not so for life in the oceans:
        the vast majority of the oceans are darker than the night where you live.
        Sea water absorbs sunlight efficiently,
        the red end of the spectrum more readily than the blue,
        which is why water
        <q>looks</q>
        blue.
        On average, light intensity decreases by half for every depth increase of \SIrange{10}{15}{metre}. At \SI{100}{metre}, the total light is less than 0.5% of that at the surface (equivalent to the brightness of the sky just after sunset<fn>

        Below this euphotic layer,
        the oceans remain in perpetually twilight to a depth of roughly \SI{1000}{metre}, where the last vestiges of light disappear,
        and eternal darkness reigns supreme.
        Roughly 65% of Earth's entire surface area,
        and 90% of the ocean's volume,
        lies deeper than \SI{1000}{metre} below the ocean surface,
        and all of it perpetually dark.
