    The receiver containing <m>CO_2</m> gas became itself much heated-very sensibly more so than the other-and on being removed [from the Sun], it was many times as long in cooling.
    An atmosphere of <m>CO_2</m> gas would give to our earth a high temperature;
    and if, as some suppose, at one period of its history,
    the air had mixed with it a larger proportion than at present,
    an increased temperature from its own action,
    as well as from increased weight,
    must have necessarily resulted.
