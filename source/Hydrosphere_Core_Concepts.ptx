        Oceans, like the atmosphere, move heat from the equator to the poles.

        Gyres are shallow, mostly horizontal circulation of ocean water,
        and effectively advect heat to the poles.

        The Meridional Overturning Circulation is a deep,
        mostly vertical circulation of ocean water.
        The movement of heat and water in the MOC is a key force moderating climate change.

        El Ni&#xf1;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a powerful and natural climate oscillation centered in the Pacific Ocean,
        which influences climate across the world.
        ENSO is strong enough to change the frequency of hurricanes,
        droughts,
        storms and disease across the globe.

        Recent changes to sea level,
        and the ocean's acidity, temperature and heat content,
        are all direct manifestations of global climate change.
