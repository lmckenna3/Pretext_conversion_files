  <title>Opening Problem</title>

    Charles August de Sales, the Bishop of Geneva, had a problem.
    His parishioners had entreated him to save them from a tireless scourge which for 30 years had destroyed houses,
    farmlands and even entire villages:
    rapidly growing glaciers.
    It was June of 1644 CE, and glaciers<mdash/>yes,
    glaciers<mdash/>were rampaging across the countryside.
    In the Medieval period a few centuries before,
    warm climate and shrinking glaciers in the European Alps allowed farmers to expand their fields high into alpine valleys.
    But by 1610 CE, colder climates and growing glaciers of the Little Ice Age had brought ruin to these villages and farm lands,
    conditions well-documented by authorities assessing the farms for taxes.
    The area surrounding Mont Blanc is now an idyllic,
    beautiful, and wealthy part of Europe,
    but in 1616 CE, one assessor found that in this part of the Alps

    the great glacier of La Rosi&#xe8;rc every now and then goes bounding and thrashing or descending; for the last five or six years...it has been impossible to get any crops from the places it has covered....Behind the village of Les Rousier, by the impetuosity of a great terrible glacier which is above and just adjoining the few houses that remain, there have been destroyed [40 acres<fn>

    went to the village of Ch&#xe2;telard where there are still about six houses, all uninhabited save two, in which live some wretched women and children, although the houses belong to others. Above and adjoining the village, there is a great and horrible glacier of great and incalculable volume which can promise nothing but the destruction of the houses and lands which still remain.

    Charles' problem was same one spreading across Europe and Asia:
    how to ameliorate famine,
    plagues, social unrest and war due to rapid climate change.
    He did the best he could,
    exorcising four different glacier and ordering them to retreat<fn>

    But the Little Ice Age was hard to stop,
    eventually leading to the death of millions from disease,
    famine and war.
    How can societies mitigate,
    perhaps even avoid, crises caused by climate change?
