    Who owns the air?
    The brief answers most often given are
    <q>no one</q>
    or
    <q>all of us,</q>
    which are oddly similar answers.
    In the United States,
    courts in different states have made different decisions regarding governments' responsibility to caring for its citizens' atmosphere.
    In May of 2015, Judge Karsten H. Rasmussen of the Oregon Circuit Court questioned
    <q>whether the atmosphere is a <sq>natural resource</sq> at all,
    much less one to which the</q>
    state had any responsibility<fn>
    Chernaik v.
    Brown, Circuit Court of The State of Oregon For Lane County,
    case Case No. 16-11-09273, 2015
    </fn>.
    The state Appeals Court of New Mexico<fn>
    Sanders-Reed v.
    Martinez, Court of Appeals of the State of New Mexico, 2015
    </fn> found that the state government <em>is</em>
    responsible for the atmosphere's care,
    but decided that those responsibilities were limited<fn>
    Ibid, pg 10, lines 14-21
    </fn>.
    Clearly something about the atmosphere<mdash/>its size,
    its transience,
    its ubiquity<mdash/>distinguishes it from something as small,
    permanent and personal as a cell phone.
    Answering the question
    <q>Who owns your iPhone?</q>
    is pretty simple.
    So too is answering the question
    <q>Who is harmed if I break your iPhone?</q>
    But can you, personally, be aggrieved if some one
    <q>harms</q>
    your atmosphere?
    Is it unethical to harm the atmosphere?
