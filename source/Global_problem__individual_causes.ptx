  <title>Global problem, individual causes</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The
      <q>ozone dilemma</q>
      of the previous section is one example of a global problem with local causes.
      Pollution is something with which we have personal experience:
      we can see, feel even feel threatened by pollutants in our environment.
      But other significant global problems are more difficult for us to perceive.
      Some changes in Earth's environment are so slow we simply can't find enough change in our lifetimes.
      Other changes act over such enormous scales of Earth's surface that we can't see them all at once.
      The ecologist Aldo Leopold noted that in dealing with Earth's environment,
      humans needed to
      <q>think like a mountain.</q>
      To understand global problems with local causes,
      we must understand that our wonderful ability to think and act have been honed over millions of years of evolution in small groups with limited geographic range.
      Those thoughts and actions are no longer enough in our globally-connected planet.

    <title>Global climate change is different</title>
    <p>
      Global climate change unfortunately has all the characteristics that make personal perception of the problem difficult.
      Climate change additionally suffers from the
      <q>ozone dilemma,</q>
      because linking causes and effects is difficult, even impossible.
      This is a point made famous by Steven Gardiner,
      in a series of papers and books all called a variation on
      <em>Perfect Moral Storm:
      the Ethical Tragedy of Climate Change</em>.
      As we'll see in the next section,
      recent changes to Earth's climate are largely due to anthropic (human-caused) release of greenhouse gasses.
      People have been releasing these gasses as part of their daily practice of living for nearly 6000 years<fn>

        But the Holocene and its comfortable climate are at an end,

        Earth is even now moving into a new epoch,

        when climate is changing rapidly and in one direction.
        We will spend the remainder of the book understanding the causes, effects,
        and implications of these changes.
        But to understand the ethical issues produced by these changes-by the individual actions of the billions of people on the planet in the past 100 years,
        those here now,
        and by the billions yet to come-we need some idea of the changes Earth's climate is experiencing.

        <title>Temperature changes</title>
        <p>
          Earth's surface temperature is increasing,
          and on average has done so since at least 1880 CE. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) noted in 2013 that
          <q>almost the entire globe</q>
          has warmed during this period,
          by an average of \SI{0.78(7)}{\degreeCelsius} (Ref<fn>
          IPCC, 2013: Summary for Policymakers.
          In: Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis.

Boschung, A. Nauels, Y. Xia, V. Bex and P.M. Midgley (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA
          </fn>).
          During the remainder of this century,
          temperatures will continue to rise in proportion to the mass of greenhouse gasses each of the billions of humans on the planet chooses to emit.
          Predicting this future is difficult,
          and in the past the IPCC has consistently
          <em>underestimated</em> emissions,
          but by the best estimates, Earth's surface will be <nbsp/>\SI{3(1)}{\degreeCelsius} degrees warmer in 2100 CE than it was in 1850-1900 CE.

        Global maps
        (<xref ref="fig_rcp_T">Figure</xref>)
        of these predicted temperature changes are sobering.
        For a business as usual trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions (the
        <q>RCP 8.5</q>
        model), global temperatures <em>increase</em>
        by an average of \SI{5}{\degreeCelsius}
        (about <m>9 \circ F</m>),
        above the average temperatures during 1986-2005.
        Much higher increases in the poles and over land are counterbalanced by smaller increases over the oceans.
        For a future where greenhouse gasses emissions are limited through concerted international efforts (the
        <q>RCP 4.5</q>
        model), global average temperatures increase only by \SI{2.5}{\degreeCelsius}
        (about <m>4.5 \circ F</m>),
        again with higher increases in the poles and on land.
      </p>
      <p>
        This increase is <em>virtually certain</em>
        to produce fewer cold days and nights,
        is <em>virtually certain</em> to produce more frequent hot days and nights,
        and is <em>very likely</em> to produce more warm spells by the end of the century.
        The scale of this heating is difficult to forecast without detailed modeling,

        At the other extreme,
        polar regions will experience widespread melting of ice and the permanently frozen ground (

        ) on which is built much of the infrastructure of the polar regions

        <p>
          Those temperature changes will in turn modify precipitation patterns
          (<xref ref="fig_rcp_P">Figure</xref>).
          Most importantly,
          by the close of this century it is <em>very likely</em>
          much of the globe will see an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation.
          The length and severity of drought will <em>likely</em>

          even while it is <em>more likely than not</em>
          that hurricanes threatening North America's eastern seaboard will become more intense.

        The oceans will also become more acidic and warmer in the future.
        By the end of the century,
        ocean water will be from 40 to 100% more acidic than it is now.
        Simultaneously the oceans, particularity the deep oceans,
        will be warming,
        by as much as \SI {3}{\kelvin}. Both of these changes will make life more difficult for marine organisms,
        including corals and fin fish.
        Corals are a foundation of the marine ecosystem.

        the pterosaurs
        (think flying dinosaurs)
        and as many as 40% of the shell-producing animals in the oceans.
        This mass extinction is not unique:

        Each of the
        <q>Big Five</q>
        eliminated more than 75% of the larger animal species extant at the time.
        While the primary cause(s) of these extinction are still being argued,
        all eventually were due to changes to Earth's climate,
        and all were due to natural events.

      <title>Humans will survive</title>
      <p>
        Despite all of the changes Earth and its environment will face in the remainder of this century,
        our species will undoubtedly survive these changes.
        In fact, those scenarios we've been using in this section include population estimates of 9 to 12 billion humans at century's end,
        equivalent to a 20% to 70% increase from 2017 CE population estimates.
        Humans will definitely survive,
        but our current cultural will not.
        The combination of changes to climate, the oceans,
        the cryosphere, population increases,
        food production and mass extinctions will mean that human culture of 2100 CE will have to adapt to succeed.

        The first societies to face necessary adaptation are all around us.
        But they tend to be societies that are distant,

        Thirty five of these more wealthy countries belong to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
        Together these countries are responsible for over 60% of the global economy<fn>

        but they make up only 18% of the global population.
        Since 1960 CE, OECD countries have released about half of all greenhouse gasses emitted by humanity,
        with non-OECD countries making up the rest<fn>

        On average, OECD residents have released about 4.5 times as much greenhouse gasses per-person as non-OECD residents.
        And yet the consequences of those emissions are now and will in the future disproportionately affect the relatively poor people in relatively poor non-OECD countries.<fn>

    <title>Social dilemmas and the need for ethical awareness</title>
    <introduction>

        <title>Forty years of knowing</title>
        <p>
          Because no one really does own the air, individuals,
          companies and countries have for millennia discharged waste products,
          like greenhouse gasses, into the atmosphere.
          For the vast majority of that time,
          the consequences of those emissions were largely unknown.
          But that convenient innocence ended at least in 1977 CE, when climatologist Wally Broecker published
          <q>Are we on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?</q>
          in the journal <em>Science</em>.
          In the article, he predicted that
          <q>the exponential rise in the atmospheric carbon dioxide content will ...by early in the next century will have driven the mean planetary temperature beyond the limits experienced during the past 1000 years.</q>
          Writing now in 2017 CE, it iss unavoidably true that for at least 40 years we've known that releasing greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere was bound to cause harm to someone,
          somewhere,
          somewhen.
        </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <p>
        But even now it is difficult to precisely determine how much damage global climate change has caused to specific people,
        specific areas, or specific times.
        Our
        <q>standard moral calculus</q>
        is that harms and their causes are personal, prompt and local.
        If I hit your car, the damage was done by me, to you,
        the damage happened as soon as I hit it,
        and we were clearly in the same place at the same time!
        But the
        <q>standard moral calculus</q>
        isn't obviously applicable to the causes and consequences of climate change.
        Sure, residents of OECD countries have released 5 times the greenhouse gasses of non-OECD residents.
        But how am I responsible for the harm to a person in another part of the world,
        a person who perhaps won't be born until after I die?
        If we have essentially no interaction with the people harmed by our actions,
        how should we choose to act ethically?
        Are we really morally responsible for the welfare of people we'll never meet,
        for people born a generation after our own death?

      <paragraphs>
        <title>Morals and ethics</title>
        <p>
          Although often used inter-changeably,
          morals and ethics are distinctly different and complimentary aspects of species.
          Ethics is about the rules and practices individuals and societies invent to do the right thing.
          Morals are the personal opinions and beliefs that define what the right thing is.
          Ethics are how morals are put in to practice.
          Ian Welsh once once wagged that
          <q>Morals are how you treat people you know;
          ethics are how you treat people you don't know.</q>
          Even briefer:
          <q>morals are about me, ethics are about everyone else</q>.
        </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <p>
        The ethical aspect is what distinguishes the study of climate change
        (and this textbook)
        from most other scientific pursuits
        (and science textbooks).
        Were you enrolled in a course on Solar System Astronomy,
        for example,
        the class would likely be devoid of the talk of ethics and morals.
        You might touch on the affect of potential impacts on society,
        or on the philosophical aspects of exoplanets and alien life,
        but these are not moral problems.
        In fact, just about about every science professor you will ever have or had as an instructor will consciously and fervently avoid the topic in her class.
        Science, after all, is about the measurable and testable,
        two topics apparently not applicable to ethics and morals.
        But climate change is different.
        Human agency is irrelevant in the study of Solar System Astronomy:
        the planet Jupiter does not care how about your morals,
        and Kepler's Laws are unchanged by the ethical choices of OECD residents.
        The same is not true of climate.

      <blockquote>
        <em>At the most general level, ... we cannot get very far in discussing why climate change is a problem without invoking ethical considerations. If we do not think that our own actions are open to moral assessment, or that various interests (our own, those of our kin and country, those of distant people, future people, animals and nature) matter, then it is hard to see why climate change (or much else) poses a problem. But once we see this, then we appear to need some account of moral responsibility, morally important interests and what to do about both. And this puts us squarely in the domain of ethics.</em>

      <title>The difference is the social dilemma</title>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Me <em>vs.</em> You or Me <em>vs.</em> Me</title>
        <p>
          Ethical considerations are necessary when studying climate change because those changes are ultimately due to choices made by individuals.
          Individuals never exist in a society of one:
          we all interact with dozens,
          hundreds, even millions of people in our daily lives.
          Despite these social connections,
          most people understandably act in a way which benefits themselves in the short term.
          But often these choices lead to less good outcomes for others in the short term,
          and in the long term to less good outcomes even for themselves.
          This is the <em>social dilemma of climate change</em><fn>
          Ostrom, Elinor (2009).
          A Polycentric Approach for Coping with Climate Change (October 1, 2009).

          The classic illustration of this concept is the Prisoner's Dilemma.
        </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <p>
        Connie and Blythe rob a bank,
        but are caught shortly afterward.
        Although accomplices, the two had never worked together previously.
        In jail they are placed in separate cells,
        and are unable to communicate with each other.
        The prosecutor visits each prisoner,
        and offers each the same deal:
      </p>
      <p>
        ''You have two choices: confess your actions or deny your guilt.
        If you confess,
        and your accomplice doesn't, you can go free and your accomplice will get a long sentence.
        If they confess and you don't, you'll get the long sentence and they walk free.
        If you both confess, you'll both do time,
        but you'll be paroled after awhile.
        If you both deny your guilt, you'll both be released with a fine.
        What do you choose to do?''
      </p>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>What would you do in this situation?</title>
        <p>
          To start, think about the <em>other</em> prisoner's choices.
          If they confess, and you deny, they go free.
          If they confess and you do too, they get some time.
          The very worst outcome for them is if they deny guilt and you confess.
          Then they do hard time.
          Your accomplice doesn't know or particularly trust you
          (you were robbing a bank, after all),
          so they expect you will do what is in your best self-interest,
          which is to confess.
          So they choose to do so, too.
          They make a perfectly rational self-interested decision which benefited them in the short-term,
          but which is detrimental to both you and them in the long-run!
          Had you both denied your guilt,
          you'd both be walking free.
          Apparently there are situations where being responsible for the welfare of others actually makes your situation better, too.

        The difficulty so many scientists have with discussing ethical issues in the classroom is also well-illustrated by the Prisoner's Dilemma.
        Your professor could easily explore with you the fascinating dynamics of the issue.
        She might even explore the surprisingly deep mathematics of this and related
        <q>public goods games,</q>
        even to the point of doing an experiment with grades on an assignment.
        She probably wouldn't even explicitly discuss the moral issues in the game,
        because most scientists are trained to test hypotheses with objective data.
        Few things are less objective than morals!
        But whether you or your professor want to deal with it explicitly or not,
        the choice you make in the prisoner's dilemma<mdash/>or any real social dilemma<mdash/>inevitably affects the welfare of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        As this chapter demonstrates,
        even casual decisions we make in our daily lives has implications for the welfare of others<mdash/>others who may live on the opposite side of the globe,
        even those not yet born.
        Our discussion of the deeply personal but important ethical issues involved in climate change is not to tell you what to do or how to think.
        Instead, these discussions should catalyze self-consideration of the ethical implications of your moral choices.
