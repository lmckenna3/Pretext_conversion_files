    <title>Introduction: The oceans move heat from the equator to the pole</title>
    <p>
      The oceans are in unceasing and tumultuous motion.
      It's one of the features that make the oceans so mesmerizing to watch,
      and one of the features that make the oceans most dangerous to live with.
      But the motions that most captivate human observers<mdash/>waves and tides come to mind<mdash/>aren't important to the ocean's long-term climatological roles.
      More subtle horizontal and vertical circulations in the oceans are what will concern us in this chapter.
      Like the overlying atmosphere,
      the fluid oceans are constantly slung about by Earth's rotation and heated by the Sun.
      Unlike the atmosphere, the oceans are dense,
      penned in by the continents, and heated from above,
      so circulation of the oceans is qualitatively different then circulation of the atmosphere.
      Currents in the ocean are 1000 times slower (\SI{0.01}{\metre\per\second}) than those in the atmosphere (\SI{10}{\metre\per\second}), so the first difference we should expect is the time it takes for the oceans to circulate
      (years to millennia)
      will be much longer than the those for the atmosphere
      (days to months).
      The second difference is that density changes within the oceans is controlled by temperature and salinity,
      both of which change only at the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Circulations in the oceans are driven by both winds and density.
      We'll find that winds in the atmosphere drive circulation in the shallow,
      warm oceans above the thermocline.
      These <em>gyres</em> move water horizontally in ocean-wide circulation cells.
      Once dragged to polar regions by circulation in gyres,
      water cools, becomes saltier and so denser.
      This dense water sinks to abyssal depths,
      forming the <em>meridional overturning circulation</em>.
      The MOC is a vertical convective circulation of the oceans,
      and the primary way oceans move heat from the equator to the poles.
      A full trip around the MOC takes thousands of years,
      most it spent in the dark,
      isolated depths of the deepest parts of the oceans.
      We'll examine each of these circulations in <xref ref="gyres">sections</xref> and <xref ref="MOCs"></xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both gyres and the MOC are global circulations,
      with examples found in every ocean basin.
      In <xref ref="ENSO">section</xref>
      we'll examine the <em>El Ni&#xf1;o-Southern Oscillation</em>
      (ENSO), a unique and culturally-important circulation in the tropical Pacific Ocean and atmosphere.
      The ENSO is a quasi-periodic but natural variation in Pacific Ocean sea surface temperature and height,
      accompanied by reversals in the circulation of the overlying atmosphere.
      While the ENSO itself is limited to the tropical Pacific Ocean,
      changes there drive changes in weather across the world,
      often leading to substantial storms and billions of dollars of damage in the United States, Australia and South America.
      A particularly strong El Ni&#xf1;o in 1982-3 caused over 1000 deaths and $13 billion in damages world-wide<fn>

        Tiny Henderson Island is about as far as you can get from other humans.
        About halfway between Chile and New Zealand
        (its location is shown by the star in <xref ref="fig_gyre">Figure</xref>)
        is \SI{5000}{\kilo\metre} (3000 miles) from any substantial human habitation<fn>

        </fn>.
        Despite this remoteness,
        the beaches of this uninhabited island are covered with plastic waste (<xref ref="fig_henderson">Figure</xref>,
        so dense one would think there had been a boisterous beach party the day before.
        All of the plastic waste in <xref ref="fig_henderson">Figure</xref>
        was bourne to the island by currents of the South Pacific gyre,
        which carries debris from as far away as Japan, Chile,
        and China<fn>
        Lavers and Bond, op cit.
        </fn>.
        Less visible is that gyres are the dominant circulation of the shallow oceans;
        we need to understand their geometry and the forces that drive them.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see in <xref ref="fig_gyre">Figure</xref>,
        gyres are a series of currents forming elliptical circulations across each ocean basin.
        <xref ref="fig_gyre_schematic">Figure</xref>
        shows a schematic view of the layout of gyres.
        Northern Hemisphere oceans,
        penned in by continents to high latitudes,
        all have two sets of gyres,
        a clockwise circulating sub-tropical gyre and a counter-clockwise gyre centered
        (except in the Indian Ocean)
        at sub-polar latitudes.
        Across the equator,
        circulation reverses so sub-tropical gyres circulate counter-clockwise.
        The Southern Ocean is not hemmed by continents,
        so the Antarctic Circumpolar Current surrounds Antarctica,
        effectively shutting off the continent from the rest of the world's oceans.
        The map colors in <xref ref="fig_gyre">Figure</xref> show that the western,
        poleward moving portions of the sub-tropical gyres are narrow,
        fast moving streams of water coursing through the oceans;
        these <em>western boundary currents</em>
        are the primary way oceans move heat from the equator toward the poles.
        The arrow colors in <xref ref="fig_gyre">Figure</xref>
        show the relative temperature of each current.
        The odd east-west dichotomy of SSTs from <xref ref="fig_sst_anom_map">Figure</xref>
        is clearly the effect of the warm and cool currents in the gyres.

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Driving Forces</title>
      <p>
        Winds alone are not enough to drive the shallow circulations seen in gyres.
        As always, we need to remember that all this motion occurs on a spinning Earth,
        and so Coriolis effects will sooner or later become important in explaining the motion.
        In the northern hemisphere,
        the Coriolis effect deflects any fluid motion to the right,
        and the same will be true for the motion of the oceans driven by winds.
        This was first noted by the famous Norwegian oceanographer,
        adventurer and Nobel peace prize-winning Fridtjof Nansen.
        In 1893 CE, he and his crew of 11 purposely locked themselves in Arctic Sea for nearly 2 years in an attempt to get to the North Pole.
        During this time, Nansen npticed that the ice would drift not with th ewind,
        but to the right.
        After his return, he mentioned this observation to Vagn Ekman,
        then a young student in graduate school.
        Ekman later set down and in a single night of remarkable creativity derived the complicated mathematics explaining Nansen's observation.
        Ekman found that Earth's rotation causes the ocean's surface to move \SIrange{30}{60}{\celsius} to the <em>right</em>
        of the wind direction in the Northern Hemisphere
        (and a similar angel to the <em>left</em>
        in the Southern Hemisphere).
        But this upper layer of the ocean drags the next layer down,
        which also then moves \SIrange{30}{60}{\celsius} to the <em>right</em>
        of the force acting on it (<xref ref="fig_ekman">Figure</xref>.
        This pattern repeats, with each layer moving to the right
        (or left, in the Southern Hemisphere)
        of the one above:
        the lowest layers might be moving opposite to the wind's direction!
        Friction and turbulence between all these moving layers reduces the current velocity with depth, so this
        <q>Ekman spiral</q>
        is rarely more than \SIrange{10}{100}{\metre} deep.
        The result is that water moves at at right angles to the wind.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can use the North Atlantic as an example.
        In the sub-tropics,
        the north-east trades induce circulation to the west and north,
        forming the North Equatorial Current.
        Trapped by winds and the eastern boundary of Norht America,
        the current pushes into the Florida Straits as the Gulf Stream,
        after which the prevailing westerlies of the temperate belt take over,
        forming the North Atlantic Current.
        The net motion is clockwise,
        and as a result the Ekman flow slowly pumps water into the center of the gyre,
        forming a low, wide dome in the sea surface.
        At the center of the dome, sea water slowly (<em>very</em> slowly,
        on the order of just \SI{1}{\metre} per week) pumping warm salty water a few hundred meters deep.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the equator and in the sub-polar gyres,
        this pump runs in reverse, sucking colder,
        fresher water from depth and drawing to the surface.
        The gyres, driven by the Ekman pump and fueled by global winds,
        determine the large scale shallow circualtion of the oceans. \paragraphs{Winds} \paragraphs{Coriolis} \paragraphs{Time scales} \paragraphs{Role as plastic waste collectors} \subparagraph{SEA results and floating trash rafts} \subparagraph{Henderson Island

  <subsection xml:id="MOCs">
    <title>Meridional Overturning Circulation</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Like the atmosphere,
        the vertical circulation of the atmosphere happens through convection.
        In the atmosphere, air warmed by Earth's surface becomes less dense,
        and rises,
        and forms the great convective systems<mdash/>the Hadley and Ferrel Cells we saw in Chapter 6.
        In the oceans,
        a different process drives large-scale vertical convection known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation,
        or MOC. Warm ocean water at the poles looses heat and gains salt from evaporation and formation of ice.
        This colder, saltier and denser water sinks deeply,
        circulates through the ocean depths,
        and then returns to the surface and eventually to the poles.
        The MOC plays two roles of interest to us<fn>
        Buckley, M. W., &amp; Marshall, J. (2016).

        and mechanisms of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation: A review.

        </fn>.
        One is that it moves heat from the southern hemisphere to the northern,
        cooling the southern polar areas and warming the northern polar areas.
        The MOC are also important for the role they play in moderating the effects of climate change, by
        <q>burying</q>
        heat deep within the oceans.
        Fully 90% of all the excess energy Earth has stored since we started affecting the climate is stored in the deep oceans by the MOC. Besides melting of the cryosphere,
        the formation and circulation of the MOC may be the most sensitive parts of the climate to human alteration.

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Connection to NA sub-tropical and sub-polar gyres</title>
      <p>
        MOCs are driven by the formation of cold, salty, dense water.
        The conditions for this to happen<mdash/>warm water underlying intensely cold air<mdash/>are most likely where warm western boundary currents meet sub-polar gyres,
        as shown by <xref ref="fig_dwf">figure</xref>.
        While many areas around Antarctica contribute to MOC formation,
        only a small area of the Atlantic has the correct combination of temperature,
        depth and salinity to start the formation of dense water<fn>
        Burls, N. J., Fedorov, A. V., Sigman, D. M., Jaccard, S. L., Tiedemann, R., &amp; Haug, G. H. (2017).
        Active Pacific meridional overturning circulation (PMOC) during the warm Pliocene.
        Science Advances, 3(9), e1700156. https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1700156
        </fn>.
        In all these areas,
        warm surface water cools by evaporation into the overlying colder air
        (<xref ref="fig_moc_xssection">Figure</xref>,
        red upward-pointing arrows).
        This cools the water and increases its salinity,
        both of which make the water denser.
        Formation of sea ice in the winter also makes the remaining water denser.
        This dense water then sinks rapidly toward the bottom,
        as shown schematically in <xref ref="fig_moc_formation">Figure</xref>
        by the downward pointing loops in the polar areas.
        The dense water sinks until it reaches water of the same density,
        typically a few \SI{1000}{\metre} below the surface.
        These newly formed
        <q>deep water</q>
        masses tend to maintain their temperature,
        salinity and hence density for centuries.
        The combinations are characteristic,
        and waters formed in different locations have names and can be tracked across the globe.
        Two of these deep waters are particularly important for our story: North Atlantic Deep Water is made in the Greenland and Labrador Seas,
        while Antarctic Bottom Water is made in the Ross and Weddell Seas
        (<xref ref="fig_dwf">Figure</xref>).
        Each of these deep waters sink and then flow equator-ward at depths,
        crossing the equator and then
        (<xref ref="fig_moc_xssection">Figure</xref>)
        rising to the surface again at about \SIrange{50}{60}{\celsius} S latitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        This upwelling is a key piece of the MOC circulation<mdash/>after all what goes down must eventually come back up.

        </fn> the gale-force winds between \SIrange{50}{60}{\celsius} S are known as the
        <q>furious fifties!</q>
        As <xref ref="fig_moc_xssection">Figure</xref> illustrates,
        these east-moving winds cause
        (via the Ekman current)
        surface currents to move northward,
        drawing both the NADW and the AABW toward the surface.
        Once there, the cold but nutrient rich waters exchange gasses with the atmosphere,
        and continue their convective motion back to their formation areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way the former NADW waters warm and eventually join the Gulf Stream,
        transporting heat from the southern hemisphere and depositing it the sub-polar areas of the North Atlantic.
        The MOC caries about 30% of all the heat passing \SI{30}{\celsius} N, with the rest carried by the atmosphere.
        This warms the northern and cools the southern hemisphere sub-polar areas<mdash/>ocean and atmosphere<mdash/>by<fn>

        </fn> \SIrange{1}{3}{\celsius}. Because the Pacific Ocean doesn't contribute to the MOC, the polar Atlantic ocean is also warmer than the Pacific Ocean,
        again by about \SI{3}{\celsius}. All of this combines to make western Europe warmer than it otherwise would be,
        although the exact degree of this warming due to MOC is vigorously debated<fn>
        see, for example, Seager, R., Battisti, D. S., Yin, J., Gordon, N., Naik, N., Clement, A. C., &amp; Cane, M. A. (2002).

        </fn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The complete trip around the MOC can take centuries,
        which means over these periods the MOC is the primary mixer of the global oceans,
        bring water from the North Atlantic to the Southern Ocean and back again.
        The MOCs<mdash/>particularly the Atlantic branch<mdash/>thus controls how fast and how much anthropogenic heat and GHG will be mixed into the oceans.
        The atmosphere has so little mass that it warms quickly when exposed to the extra energy trapped by anthropogenic GHGs.
        The land's surface is much more massive than the atmosphere,
        but the land doesn't circulate,
        so a relative thin portion of Earth's surface warms rapidly when exposed to extra heat.
        The oceans are both massive <em>and</em> circulating,
        so they can store extensive heat throughout their depth,
        <em>if</em> the Atlantic MOC is operating well and mixing the oceans.
        Since 1960 CE, about 90% of all the solar heat trapped by man-made GHGs has been trapped in the oceans,
        and the deep oceans share of that is increasing rapidly.
        On the short term<mdash/>less than a human lifetime<mdash/>that's good news.
        The oceans have on average only warmed by a tiny \SI{0.06}{\celsius} in the past 60 years<fn>
        Cheng, L., Trenberth, K. E., Fasullo, J., Boyer, T., Abraham, J., &amp; Zhu, J. (2017).
        Improved estimates of ocean heat content from 1960 to 2015.

        They have total ocean heat gain since 1960 CE as <m>\Delta Q_{1960}=\SI{33.5e22}{\joule}</m>;
        given the mass of the oceans
        <m>M_o=\SI{1.3e21}{\kilogram}</m> and the heat capacity of sea water <m>C_{p, sw}=\SI{3.985e3}{\joule\kilogram\per\kelvin}</m>,
        <m>\Delta T=\frac{\Delta Q}{M_o\cdot C_{p, sw}}</m>
        </fn> This tiny change is an average,
        but it makes the point that the massive oceans can store a great deal of heat without changing temperature.
        Had all that heat been left in the atmosphere,
        we'd have seen nearly 10 times more warming than actually occurred,
        for a total of \SI{8}{\celsius}, or <m>16\cdot F</m>.
        As Buckley and Marshall<fn>
        op. cit
        </fn> note, the MOC is now
        <q>essentially setting the pace of global warming well into the 22nd century</q>
        But on long terms,
        the increasing temperature of the oceans threatens to slow down the MOC, and this could have significant global consequences.
        The MOC's global power is tied directly to the formation of NADW in the Labrador and Greenland Seas,
        right where the two North Atlantic gyres meet,
        at the southern apex of Greenland.

        The two broad categories of ocean currents we just examined
        (<xref ref="gyres">Section</xref>
        and <xref ref="MOCs">Section</xref>)
        clearly showed that ocean currents are driven by winds at the ocean surface.
        The influence was one way: winds blow, water flows.
        Now we turn our attention to the El Ni&#xf1;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a coupled see-saw motion of ocean and atmosphere in the tropical Pacific Ocean.
        The ENSO is the largest (natural) source of climatic variability over 2-10 year periods<fn>

        and even affects the global atmospheric concentration of <m>CO_2</m>.
        Anomalously warm sea surface temperatures in El Ni&#xf1;o periods and cold anomalies during La Ni&#xf1;a episodes are accompanied by whole-scale reorganizations of atmospheric pressure and winds in the Pacific and weather across the globe.
        ENSO cycles typically develop in April to June,
        reach their full strength between October-February,
        and then fade away, replaced by normal conditions<fn>

      <p>
        The changes to winds and SST during an ENSO are of fundamental importance to our planet's climate,
        and it is all-too-easy to focus one's attention of just these patterns.
        Equally important for us though is understanding how tightly coupled feedbacks between sea surface temperature,
        atmospheric pressure and the resulting winds in the equatorial Pacific Ocean combine to produce an ENSO. To understand this,
        we'll first look at
        <q>normal</q>
        conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean,
        and then use this to derive the forces behind the ENSO cycle.

      <title>Pacific SSTs</title>
      <p>
        <xref ref="fig_enso_norm">Figure</xref>
        shows average sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean,
        and it's hard to miss the enormous pool of warm water
        (greater than \SI{27}{\celsius}, shown with a light-pink color)
        in the western Pacific basin.
        On the other edge of the basin,
        cool deep water upwells along the coast of South America
        (shown in blues and greens).
        This water is rich in nutrients and <m>CO_2</m>,
        and once it reaches the surface it fuels remarkable biologic productivity,
        beginning with phytoplankton and ending
        (until recently)
        with consumers such as anchovy and other fish.
        This relatively cold water is dragged by the South Equatorial Current
        (see <xref ref="gyres">Section</xref>)
        to the west;
        the SEC is in turn largely driven by south-easterly trade winds
        (the large open arrows on <xref ref="fig_enso_norm">Figure</xref>.)
        As it travels across the Pacific, the water warms,
        and eventually trade winds pile the warm water against the western edge of the Pacific.
        The Western Pacific Warm Pool,
        propped up by trade winds and heated by intense sunlight,
        sits \SI{30}{\centi\metre} higher than its cooler counterparts in South America.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Walker Circulation</title>
      <p>
        Water in the warm pool readily evaporates into the overlying atmosphere.
        Humid air is less dense than dry air (Chapter 6),
        so it rises, cools and forms towering thunderstorms
        (<xref ref="fig_wpwp_tstorms">Figure</xref>)
        as part of a regional low pressure system (<xref ref="fig_Walker">Figure</xref>,
        lower panel.
        Off at the east edge of the Pacific the relatively cold waters induce sinking in the overlying atmosphere,
        forming a regional high pressure system with clear skies and little rain.
        At the Equator the Coriolis effect is vanishingly small,
        so winds flow from the high to the low pressure areas,
        augmenting the trade winds and reinforcing the formation of the Western Pacific Warm Pool.
        This Walker Cell completes a circuit high in the atmosphere,
        connecting the low level westward flow with a high level eastward flow,
        as shown in <xref ref="fig_Walker">Figure</xref>, lower panel.
        This is a classic positive feedback system,
        with trade winds establishing the Western Pacific Warm Pool,
        which then initiates circulation in the atmosphere,
        which then strengthens the trade winds, amplifying the Warm Pool.
        This elegant description was first made by Bjerknes in 1969 CE<fn>

        became a household term, and the
        <q>Bjerknes Feedback</q>
        is named in his honor.

    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection xml:id="enso_cycle">
      <title>The ENSO cycle</title>
      <p>
        But positive feedbacks work both ways:
        whether a signal grows stronger or weaker,
        a positive feedback amplifies the change.
        So if<mdash/>for whatever reason<mdash/>trade winds weaken for a period,
        the Western Pacific Warm Pool will start moving westward,
        dragging the associated low with it.
        As the east-west difference in SST grows smaller,
        so too does the Walker circulation,
        weakening winds and allowing the warm water to slosh eastward.
        In a classic El Ni&#xf1;o, the warm water pool surges all the way to South America,
        forcing the thermocline to sink in the eastern Pacific and stifling the upwelling of nutrient-rich waters there.
        Rain follows the warm pool,
        and moves from the Western Pacific to eastward of the International Date Line.
        The Walker Cell effectively reverses,
        and a new temporarily stable pattern<mdash/>the El Ni&#xf1;o<mdash/>is born.
        A typical cycle starts in April, reaches a peak in the
        (southern hemisphere)
        summer from December to February, and fades a year latter.
        This is all nicely shown by <xref ref="fig_oni">Figure</xref>,
        which shows the departures of central Pacific SST from the long-term average (The four circles on the graph indicate the times shown in <xref ref="fig_enso_stages">Figure</xref>).
        El Ni&#xf1;os<mdash/>reflecting higher SST<mdash/>are shown as red spikes,
        with taller,
        broader spikes indicating stronger and longer-lasting episodes.
        An El Ni&#xf1;o is defined by a departure of <m>></m>\SI{0.5}{\celsius} from the norm,
        with increasingly stronger episodes at \SIlist{1.0; 1.5; 2.0}{\celsius}. Take the time to count the number of El Ni&#xf1;o during the 1950-2020 period.
        Depending on how you count a few close calls,
        you should find 23 events in <m>2018-2050=68</m> years.
        So the average period is
        <men>
          Period=\frac{68\ years}{23\ events}\approx 3\ years/event
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        <xref ref="fig_oni">Figure</xref>
        also shows that most El Ni&#xf1;os are followed by La Ni&#xf1;as,
        episodes of colder-than-normal water in the mid-Pacific
        (<xref ref="fig_enso_stages">Figure</xref>, bottom panel).
        Although just as frequent as their warm counter=parts, La Ni&#xf1;as are generally weaker and less globally-important than El Ni&#xf1;o's they follow.
        They physics behind this is still not well-understood<fn>
        McPhaden, et al., op. cit.
        </fn> An excellent way to conceive of all this motion is to imagine the Warm Pool as the crest of a warm,
        high wave at the ocean's surface.
        Once released by weakening trade winds,
        this wave propagates over a few month period across the Pacific Ocean,
        reflects off the western coast of South America,
        then travels back across the Pacific<fn>
        Wang, C., and J. Picaut, (2004) Understanding ENSO physics - A review,
        in Earth's Climate: The Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction, Geophysical Monograph Series, Volume 147,
        edited by C. Wang, S.-P. Xie,
        and J. A. Carton, pp. 21-48, AGU, Washington, D. C.
        </fn>.
        Waves have both an crest and a trough;
        the trough following the warm pool is cool,
        and produces the La Nin&#xf1;a, which slowly dissipates as it reaches the mid-Pacific.
        As an La Ni&#xf1;a episode ends,
        the Pacific is back to a normal condition,
        awaiting the beginning of the next episode.

        A strong El Nin&#xf1;o reorganizes atmospheric circulation across the entire Pacific basin.
        Importantly for those of us in North America,
        the mid-latitude jet stream moves southward during the Northern Hemisphere winter<fn>

        This southward swing to the Jet Stream brings the strong storm systems typical of the Alaskan Gulf to the shores of California.
        It was these storms that led the Los Angeles Times to publish over 1000 articles on El Ni&#xf1;o during the 1997-1998 episode!
        That year flooding caused landslides, floods
        (contributing to the deaths oof over 60 people in California alone)
        and other damages of more than $1 billion.
        Flooding and heavy rains propagated across the sothern United States that year,

        (eight dead)
        and Florida.
        As <xref ref="fig_enso_affects">Figure</xref>,
        this pattern of changes is typical,
        with increased precipitation along the entire southern tier of the U.S. The polar jet stream in North America move northward at the same time,
        allowing warmer and drier air to invade the northwestern US and SW Canada.
        The winter of 1997-1998 was so warm in the northern U.S. that fatalities due to cold fell by 98% that year.
        Partly because it was well-predicted,

        The ENSO is not a by=product of global climate change,

        So ENSO is, at least by human scales, an ancient phenomenon,
        and clearly pre-dates even the beginnings of human's climate modifications.
        And while the warming oceans will bring a host of changes to the planets,
        it is still not clear if a changing ENSO pattern is one of them.

        shows that the strength of the strongest EL Ni&#xf1;os has increased linearly since 1950 CE, this is just one of many ways to measure the intensity of the ENSO, and the data set is still too brief to see a strong climate-change signal in the noisy natural variations of ENSO.
