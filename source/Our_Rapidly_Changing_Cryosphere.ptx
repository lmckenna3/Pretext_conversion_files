    <blockquote>
      Fifth, the response to the combined SIC/SCE loss suggests that the zonal jet-stream winds are weakened and the jet is shifted northward. The large-scale waves are amplified, which tends to favour more persistent weather systems and a higher likelihood of summer weather extremes. Although there is much still to learn about the interactions between a rapidly changing Arctic and large-scale circulation patterns, this study builds on earlier work and provides further evidence linking snow and ice loss in the Arctic with summer extreme weather in mid-latitudes. As greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere and all forms of Arctic ice continue to disappear, we expect to see further increases in summer heat extremes in the major population centres across much of North America and Eurasia where billions of people will be affected.

    <blockquote>
      The behaviour of ice shelves is very important for maintaining the ice sheets. Changes in the shape and size of the shelf, whether due to collapse or increased basal melt, can weaken the maintaining mechanism. Much of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet exists on bedrock that is below sea level, creating the possibility of marine-ice-sheet instability. This instability comes from the combination of the retrograde bed slope to the centre of the ice sheets and the decreasing ocean freezing point with depth. Simply, it means that once the grounding line has retreated, basal melting at the grounding line (which is moving deeper) becomes more active, thus leading to further retreat of the grounding line and ultimately massive loss of the ice sheet.
