    Captain Ahab:
    <q>But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea;
    there's time for that.
    An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young;
    aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy,
    from the sand-hills of Nantucket!
    The same!<mdash/>the same!<mdash/>the same to Noah as to me.</q>
