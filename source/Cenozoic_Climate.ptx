  <title>Setting up the present: Earth's climate over the past 65 Ma</title>
  <subsection>
    <title>A generally warmer Earth</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        We take for granted that the world we live in,
        with ice-covered poles and warm tropical oceans,
        is ''normal.'' But as we've seen repeatedly throughout this book, Earth's climate oscillates between two stable states:
        a warmer greenhouse world and a colder icehouse world<fn>
        Anagnostou, E., John, E. H., Edgar, K. M., Foster, G. L., Ridgwell, A., Inglis, G. N., ... &amp; Pearson, P. N. (2016).
        Changing atmospheric CO 2 concentration was the primary driver of early Cenozoic climate.

        </fn>.
        The difference between these states is starkly evident in the Cenozoic Era,
        the part of Earth's history that began roughly 66 Ma
        (with giant impact that extirpated the non-bird dinosaurs)
        and continues to today.
        Earth sat firmly in the hothouse state for the first 30 My of the Cenozoic,
        with global temperatures at least 5 K warmer than now,
        and reptiles living comfortably near the ice-free poles.
        All this warmth was driven by extraordinarily high concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere<fn>

        </fn>,
        with <m>CO_2</m> estimated from proxy data at 3000-4500 ppm,
        over ten times contemporary levels!
        The highest temperatures were during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum,
        roughly 51-53 Ma, when Earth's average surface temperature soared \SI{14(3)}{\celsius} higher than our pre-industrial average,
        driven by the high (<nbsp/>1400 ppm) concentration of <m>CO_2</m> in the atmosphere.
        Over millions of years
        (<xref ref="fig_cz_climate_from_zachos">Figure</xref>),
        plate tectonic cycles and weathering of the continents slowly withdrew the <m>CO_2</m> from the atmosphere and deposited it in marine sediments.

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Hyperthermal episodes</title>
      <p>
        Those slow, majestic cycles produced slow,
        majestic changes to Earth's climate.
        But the Cenozoic period was also time of numerous <em>hyperthermals</em>,
        brief episodes of extraordinary warmth and high
        <m>[CO_2]_{atm}</m> that provide natural examples for how Earth will respond to our continuing release of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere.
        Humans currently release roughly 10 GtC into the atmosphere every year<fn>

        Earth's systems needed almost 200 ka to recover from this release,
        which is in good accord with climate models.
        Earth's response to the PETM C surge teaches us three things.
        First, because humans most likely won't release 10,000 Gt of C into the atmosphere<fn>

        </fn>,
        we will see smaller changes than observed in the PETM. Second,
        our rate of C release into the atmopshere is 10 times that of the PETM, so climate change will be faster now than during the PETM. Many species,
        on land ind in the oceans,
        will be unable to adapt to changing conditions fast enough to avoid extinction.
        Finally, our study of the PETM shows that humanity's experiment with twiddling the control knobs of the climate system will persist for tens,
        even hundreds, of thousand of years into the future.

      <title>Beginnings of the chill: Antarctic ice develops</title>
      <p>
        Soon after the PETM, Earth's surface temperature peaked at \SI{14(3)}{\celsius} above pre-industrial temperatures,
        which works out to an astonishing <em>average</em>
        surfaace temperatuer of <m>84\pm 6 ^\circ\,F</m>!<fn>

        </fn>.
        During this time,
        <m>CO_2</m> concentrations were around 1400 ppm (Figure CZ-climate),
        about what Earth will have if humans burn all of the known,
        and most of the suspected, fossil fuels stored in the crust<fn>
        Zachos et al., op cit.

        contributing a total of 5000 GtC.
        </fn>.
        But after peaking 52 Ma, atmospheric <m>CO_2</m> began to fall slowly,
        and so too did surface temperatures.
        Just prior to 33 Ma, tectonic plate motion finally separated Antarctica from both South America and Australia,
        allowing the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to form,
        essentially isolating Antarctica from warm tropical seas.
        Glaciers rapidly spread across eastern Antarctica,
        plunging Earth into a new icehouse state<fn>

        </fn>.
        Only around 10 Ma did temperatures fall low enough to allow ice sheets to spread across Greenland and higher places on the continents.
        Icehouse was coming, but only after a last, brief warm period,
        one which has significant similarities to the Earth we are creating now through global climate change.

    <title>The mid-Pliocene: An analog for our near future?</title>
    <p>
      This was the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP), which lasted from 3.3 to 3.0 Ma.
      During this period (about as long as modern
      <em>Homo sapiens</em> have existed<fn>
      Hublin, J. J., Ben-Ncer, A., Bailey, S. E., Freidline, S. E., Neubauer, S., Skinner, M. M., ... &amp; Gunz, P. (2017).

      </fn>) <m>CO_2</m> concentrations were in the range 350-450 ppm,
      and global average temperatures were \SIrange{2.7}{4}{\celsius} warmer than today.
      That climate was quite different than ours,
      with seas \SIrange{15}{25}{\metre} (50-80 feet) higher than now,
      a more energetic water cycle,
      strong polar amplification and a much reduced crysophere<fn>

      </fn> The warmer,
      wetter atmosphere actually steered Hadley cell circulation toward the poles,
      resulting in changed precipitation patterns and smaller deserts.
      As we've seen with recent climate change,
      the poles warmed the most,
      with both proxy data and models suggesting increases of greater than \SI{10}{\celsius} in both the Arctic and Antarctic.
      You may have noticed that even though the MPWP climate was far different from ours today,
      atmospheric <m>CO_2</m> concentrations in the MPWP were about what we have now.
      This is an accurate and crucial observation.
      The MPWP gives us insight into the <em>equilibrium</em>
      climate Earth will have once our
      <q>experiment</q>
      is over and Earth has fully adjusted to the changes we've imposed.
      Earth's climate needs thousands<fn>

      of years to adjust to the enormous changes we're imposing on it,
      so the current climate is only a transitional one.
      The choices our species makes now will affect Earth for as long as our species has been on the planet.
