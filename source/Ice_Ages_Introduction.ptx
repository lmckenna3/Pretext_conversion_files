    Our goal in this (final) chapter of Part II is to understand recent climate variations, where
    <q>recent</q>
    is in the geologic sense of the past 3 My or so.
    While such a span is long compared to a human life time<mdash/>even to our species' life time<mdash/>the past 3 My represent only 0.07% of Earth's history,
    equivalent to the time of two seconds in an hour long period.
    The very end of this period,
    the past 6000 years or so, is unique in Earth history.
    Over that period we, <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em>,
    have come to dominate the planet,
    and extended our control over the very machinery of climate.
    This has profoundly altered all five planetary spheres.
