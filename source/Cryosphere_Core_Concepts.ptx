        The Cryosphere<mdash/>the part of Earth dominated by ice in all its forms<mdash/>is the smallest,
        most volatile and most endangered of all Earth's spheres.

        Because ice and snow have relatively high albedos,
        the cryosphere exerts exceptional power on global and regional energy balance over many time scales<mdash/>from months to millions of years.

        Earth history has been punctuated by multiple episodes of profound glaciation,
        including the current period of Ice Ages,
        which began roughly 33 Myr.

      <p>
        Current episodes of Ice Ages begin and end periodically,
        due to periodic variations in earth's orbit which change the insolation incident on the northern hemisphere.
        These Milankovich cycles are due to the gravitational effects of other planets on Earth's orbit.

        Global climate change is amplified in the poles,
        and profound changes to the Cryosphere are certain within your lifetime
