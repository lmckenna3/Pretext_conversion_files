      The four principal GHG are water vapor,
      carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
      All of them are minor components of the atmosphere,
      but produce the vast majority of the Greenhouse Effect.
      While water vapor will turn out to be the largest contributor,
      we'll see that it is not the most climatologically important greenhouse gas.
      That role belongs to carbon dioxide.

      changes.

    <title>The four principal greenhouse gasses</title>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Water vapor</title>
      <p>
        Water is unique: no other substance can be found in solid,
        liquid and gaseous form on Earth's surface.
        Water vapor is the gaseous form of water,
        and it generally exists dissolved into air,
        just like salt dissolves in water.
        On average, water vapor makes up just 0.2 to 0.5% of the atmosphere<fn>
        The lower limit is an area-weighted global annual average 1000-300 mb specific humidity, 1981-2010 Climatology from NOAA NCEP-NCAR CDAS-1: Climate Data Assimilation System I; NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis Project,

        upper limit is from T.J. Blasing, Recent Greenhouse Gas Concentrations,

        </fn>,
        more in the tropics, and less in the poles.
        As that observation suggests,
        the concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere is strongly proportional to temperature,
        rising about 6% for every \SI{1}{\kelvin} temperature increase (3.5% for every <m>1^{\circ}F</m> increase).
        Water vapor constantly moves across the globe
        (<xref ref="fig_wv_vis">Figure</xref>)
        due to atmospheric circualtion,
        and just as constantly cycles from the atmosphere to the oceans,
        cryosphere and geosphere, and back in to the atmosphere.
        Because of its raw abundance,
        water vapor provides about half of the total greenhouse effect
        (precise values are given in <xref ref="tab_ghgconcs">Table</xref>).

      <title>Carbon Dioxide</title>
      <p>
        Macbeth is the star of Shakespeare's shortest and darkest play,
        <em>The Tragedy of Macbeth</em>.
        During the play Macbeth savagely slaughters his King,
        his best friend, the wife and child of his kinsman,
        a few of his own guards, and drives his Queen to suicide.
        He's an odd
        <q>hero</q>
        for a play.
        Carbon dioxide is the Macbeth of this book.
        It's the central character,
        the moody and ever-present actor, in climate science,
        and though of course it lacks Macbeth's moral flaws,
        carbon dioxide certainly can play the antihero.
        Carbon dioxide is ubiquitous,
        found in various forms in the atmosphere, hydrosphere,
        geosphere,
        biosphere and even<mdash/>trapped as tiny,
        ice-surrounded bubbles<mdash/>in the cryosphere.
        We'll spend all of Chapter 11 understanding the crucial role of carbon in Earth's climate.
        For now, we need only to know that carbon dioxide makes up just [409, 412, 414, 416, 419] parts per million
        (abbreviated ppm)
        of the atmosphere [in mid-year 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 respectively]<fn>
        I don't intend that the book actually have this terminology;
        rather I include this so the book is up-to-date when published,
        and I don't have to continually recalculate the value!
        The extrapolation here uses NOAA's global <m>CO_2</m>
        <q>trend</q>
        data (
        <url href="ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_gl.txt">Link here</url>,
        accessed 11 May 2019, complete from Jan 1980 to Feb 2019),
        fit to a quadratic model in time,
        and extrapolated to mid years. 95% CI on the extrapolations are less than 0.3 ppm
        </fn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <em>part per million</em> is a common way of expressing the concentration of trace constituents,
        and in this case refers to the number of molecules of carbon dioxide found in one million molecules of
        <q>air.</q>
        One way of envisioning the ppm unit is to think of $10,000, all in pennies.
        Take $4 worth of those one million pennies,
        paint them red, then mix them into the other $9,996.
        Those red pennies are 400 ppm of the total.
        The terminology is so common in climate studies we need a handy way of writing
        <q>the concentration of this molecule in this place is this,</q>
        which we do this way:
        <men>
          [CO_2]_{atm}=412\ ppm
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        The square brackets are read as
        <q>concentration of,</q>
        the chemical formula in the brackets identifies the compound of interest,
        and the subscript gives the particulars of where
        (or when)
        the concentration was measured.

        The lifetime of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is anywhere from 100 to 1000 years,
        depending on how one defines the lifetime.
        We'll define it as the time before a molecule is removed from the atmosphere by any process.
        The implications of this should surprise you:
        next time you use a gasoline-powered vehicle,
        step back and look at the exhaust before you get in the vehicle.

        http://www.epa.gov/oms/fetrends.htm# accessed 30 January 2016 report that average <m>CO_2</m> emissions for the US average fleet is
        (for the 1990-2014 period,
        weighted by a triangular distribution with mean = 2014-11.4=2002.6)
        is 420 g <m>CO_2</m>\/mile.
        Assume average speed of 33 mph=0.55 mileminute=230 gminute
        </fn>,
        for every minute you drive,
        that car will emit about 230 g<mdash/>roughly
        <em>one half pound</em><mdash/>of carbon dioxide.
        That gas will remain in the atmosphere at least until your great-grandchildren are breathing it,
        and probably much longer.
        The growth of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere-largely due to human-caused emissions-amounts to about 0.6%, or roughly 2.5 ppm,
        per year<fn>
        This is the exponentially smoothed 2018 growth rate (alpha=0.25) for <m>CO_2</m> based on the NOAA's
        <q>measured global annual mean dry-air mole fractions used in deriving the radiative forcing values provided in ... the AGG,</q>
        available at https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/NOAA_MoleFractions_2019.csv
        </fn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite its tiny abundance,
        carbon dioxide is responsible for about one quarter of the entire greenhouse effect.
        This is because Earth happens to radiate infrared light at precisely the same wavelengths carbon dioxide absorbs it
        (<xref ref="fig_sun_earth_spectrum">Figure</xref>),
        and because carbon dioxide is an efficient absorber of that infra-red radiation.
        A decent way of measuring the ability of a greenhouse gas to influence climate is through the
        <em>global warming potential</em>,
        or GWP. This is a relative measure,
        and by convention the GWP for carbon dioxide is set at 1.
        The GWP of water, although it is hard to measure accurately<fn>
        Because their absorbencies overlap,
        the relative contributions of water and carbon dioxide to the total GHE is indeterminate.
        Students find this enormously frustrating.
        So I calculate and approximate measure by dividing actual GHG concentrations by the CDAIC AGGI contributions from each GHG, then normalizing those ratios to that for <m>CO_2</m>.
        These values were within factor of <nbsp/>2 of IPCC 100 year GWP. The corresponding ratio for H2O is 0.2, relative to <m>CO_2</m>.
        I fully acknowledge this is at best an approximation,
        and at worst a pedagogical extrapolation.
        But I think the cost in terms of precise physics is offset by the increased accuracy of students' understanding.
        </fn>,
        is about one fifth that of carbon dioxide.
        Roughly speaking,
        one molecule of carbon dioxide has 5 times the potency of one water molecule to warm the climate.
        Water is more important overall because there is ten times more water vapor in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.

      <title>Methane</title>
      <p>
        Methane<mdash/>a common molecule found from Earth's deep interior,
        to the surface to the atmosphere<mdash/>is a simple molecule consisting of a central carbon atom and 4 surrounding hydrogen atoms.
        The majority of natural methane emissions come from wetlands<fn>
        Anderson, Brian, et al.
        <em>Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from natural sources.</em>
        United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Atmospheric Programs, Washington (2010).
        </fn>,
        where it is released as a byproduct of oxygen-free decay of organic matter.
        Bubbles of methane rising from such places has the wonderful name of
        <q>swamp gas.</q>
        But these natural emissions now represent only 40% of global emissions.
        The other 60% comes from human activity,
        including the production of natural gas and coal,
        the gaseous discharge from the intestines of domesticated animals
        (largely cattle),
        and from rice paddies.
        Natural gas,
        which is an increasingly important source of energy in the United States,
        is largely methane.
        While the contemporary concentration of [1.87, 1.88, 1.89, 1.90, 1.91] ppm in mid-year [2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 respectively] has increased recently (around 0.4% per year.<fn>
        NOAA, ibid.
        </fn>), the rate of increase is quite variable over 5 to 10 year periods.
        The reasons for this are still hotly debated,
        but include increases in the methane released by microbes
        (often found in rice paddies and the guts of cattle),
        from increased fossil fuel production,
        and a decrease in the rate methane is removed from the atmosphere,
        or a combination of all three<fn>

        <url href="http://doi.org/10.1029/2018GB006009">This doi</url>
        </fn>.
        Over the past 250 years,
        humans have more than doubled atmospheric methane concentrations, Methane has a GWP of 28,
        so despite its low concentrations it is a powerful greenhouse gas,
        fueling about 6% of the greenhouse effect.
        Once in the atmosphere,
        methane is destroyed over a 10 year period by reactions with naturally-occurring compounds in the atmosphere.

      <title>Nitrous oxide</title>
      <p>
        Yes, laughing gas is a greenhouse gas,
        the least influential of the top four gasses we'll consider in detail.
        This gas is still rare-only [0.332 0.332 0.333 0.334 0.335] ppm in mid-year [2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 respectively<fn>
        NOAA, ibid.
        </fn>] and has only increased about 25% since pre-industrial times.
        This low increase reflects the fact that almost two thirds of all nitrous oxide reaching the atmosphere is from natural sources,
        mostly from bacterial activity in soils and the oceans.
        This also explains the gas's relatively slow increase of 0.3% annually.
        Growing food<fn>

        aided by nitrogen-rich application of fertilizers and manures,
        is the primary source of anthropic nitrous oxide,
        although burning of fossil fuels contributes a small amount as well.
        Nitrous oxide is removed from the atmosphere by bacteria,
        or destroyed by chemical reactions and ultraviolet light.
        With a long lifetime (120 years) and remarkably high GWP (265),
        nitrous oxide provides a small but important 2% of the GHE.

      <title>Greenhouse Gasses and Human Needs</title>
      <p>
        Buried in the dry recitation of facts above are hints of ideas we will revisit often,
        but should start considering now.
        Look back and notice that both methane and nitrous oxide are released through agricultural practice:
        bovine emissions and rice paddies for methane,
        fertilizer for nitrous oxide.
        Of course in most parts of the developed world,
        these crops and animals are cared for,
        harvested and transported by vehicles consuming fossil fuels and emitting carbon dioxide,
        the other important GHG. Something as necessary and fundamental to existence as growing food is a primary source of the very gasses that are threatening our way of life.
        This could be quite a dilemma:
        could it really come down to choosing to heat or to eat?

  <subsection>
    <title>Feedbacks</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Back in Chapter 3 we defined a system as a collection of interacting parts.
        One important type of interaction in climate systems are feedbacks,
        in which one part of the system affects another part, and that one yet another,
        and so on until the initial part itself is affected.
        Such feedback loops are common in any complicated system,
        including living organisms, human societies, and of course climate.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Block diagrams and mechanics</title>
      <p>
        A handy way of visualizing such a loop is a block diagram,
        as shown in <xref ref="fig_feedback_loops_intro">Figure</xref>.
        Block diagrams represents parts of the system as blocks,
        and interactions between the parts as lines.
        Inputs to a block represent interaction signals from other parts of the system,
        while outputs are resulting signals sent to other parts.
        The signal represents how change in one part of the system will change the next part along the loop.
        Signals have one of two values:
        positive or negative.
        A positive signal means the two parts will change in the same sense:
        if one goes down, the other will, too.
        In this book,
        positive signals are shown in block diagrams with green lines ending in a filled circle.
        A negative signal means the parts change in the opposite sense:
        if one increases, the other will decrease, and <em>vice versa</em>.
        Negative signals are shown with red dashed lines ending in an unfilled circle,
        as shown in the center of <xref ref="fig_feedback_loops_intro">Figure</xref>. (A signal of
        <q>no change</q>
        is possible, but irrelevant;
        such a signal would mean the parts really don't interact!)
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Positive and Negative Feedback Loops</title>
      <p>
        Interaction is the primary reason we'll study feedback loops,
        because loops interact to either amplify or dampen changes that occur to a system.
        Two examples illustrate this crucial concept.
        Collegiate wrestlers compete in narrowly-defined weight classes,
        so a wrestler typical monitors her weight closely.
        A very simplified feedback loop of the system <em>Wrestler</em>
        is shown in the Panel A of <xref ref="fig_feedback_loops_intro">Figure</xref>.
        Jump in to the loop at <em>Calories Consumed</em>
        and follow the positive signal output to <em>Body Weight</em>.
        This indicates that if a wrestler were to increase her caloric intake while keeping all other factors constant,
        her weight would increase.
        The opposite is also true: fewer calories would lead to weight loss.
        This is a <em>positive</em> interaction,
        because the changes have the same sign.
        Follow the negative output from
        <em>Body Weight</em> to <em>Caloric Intake</em>
        and you'll see that in response to her weight gain,
        the wrestler would need to reduce her subsequent caloric intake, which
        (follow the loop around!)
        would eventually lead to weight loss.
        Note how this loop acts to dampen, or reduce,
        weight changes and leads to the maintenance of a steady state weight.
        Any complicated system which remains near a steady state condition for the long term is dominated by such
        <em>negative feedback loops</em>.
        Don't let the word <em>negative</em> fool you:
        it refers not to the goodness or desirability of the outcome,
        but to the fact that the scale of change is reduced on each passage through the loop.
        Not surprisingly, positive loops amplify change on each passage.
        In the upper right of <xref ref="fig_feedback_loops_intro">Figure</xref>
        is a simplified block diagram of a Student.
        The student, for whatever reason,
        reduces his exercise intensity for a period of time.
        As you may have experienced,
        this leads to a decrease in the student's conditioning,
        which in turn leads to a further reduction in the student's exercise intensity.
        Eventually the student may find himself in pretty poor shape,
        and stop exercising all together.
        Despite the unfortunate outcome,
        this is a positive feedback loop,
        because the change grows larger with each trip around the loop.
        Positive loops are inherently unstable:
        even a small initial change can lead to arbitrarily large changes over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Determining the nature of a loop is easy:
        count the number of negative signals.
        If a loop has an odd number of negative signals,
        the loop is itself negative.
        The lower panel of <xref ref="fig_feedback_loops_intro">Figure</xref>
        shows changes in the wrestler's weight
        (in red)
        and student's conditioning
        (in green)
        over time.
        While the wrestler's weight increases suddenly and dramatically,
        her weight returns quickly to the initial weight after a few trips around the loop,
        even if it overshoots that steady state value on the return.
        On the other hand,
        the student's conditioning initially drops only slightly,
        but that change is rapidly amplified.

        For nearly 4 billion years, Earth's climate,
        while varying widely for short periods of time,
        has been sufficiently stable and comfortable for life to flourish through the oceans,
        across the surface,
        into the atmosphere and even tens of kilometers deep in the geosphere.
        What a remarkable example of long-term maintenance of a steady state in a complicated system!
        Many strong,
        persistent and overlapping negative feedbacks have maintained a habitable climate on Earth for billions of years.
        Oddly enough, though,
        the first feedback we need to look at is a positive one,
        and involves carbon dioxide, water and the greenhouse effect.

    <title>The Role of Carbon Dioxide and other Non-Condensable Gasses in the greenhouse effect</title>

        was taken in the Schmidt Hills of Antarctica,
        and shows the frozen Polar Plateau leading off to the Ronne Ice Shelf in the background.
        At the time the photograph was taken,
        the air temperature was a balmy \SI{-5}{\celsius} (<m>20^{\circ}</m> F), pretty mild for Antarctica.
        Today the ice there is a thousand meters
        (more than 3000 feet)
        thick, but the smoothness of the rocky ridge in the background suggests that the ice at one time covered the ridge as well.
        The ice is nothing more than compacted snow,
        but to the surprise of most people,
        snow in Antarctica is actually pretty rare,
        simply because the air is too cold to hold much water.
        Antarctica is a unique and spectacular part of planet Earth,
        but much of the planet's surface would look like the landscape in <xref ref="fig_schmidt_hills">Figure</xref>
        if it weren't for the effects of carbon dioxide as a
        <em>non-condensable gas</em>:
        a gas that doesn't freeze to a solid on the surface.

      <title>Specific humidity <em>vs.</em> temperature</title>
      <p>
        To act as a greenhouse gas, water must dissolve into the air.
        This process is similar to the dissolution of salt in water.
        The dissolved salt is invisible in the water,
        at least to the naked eye.
        There is also a limit to how much salt a given amount of water can dissolve,
        which defines the solubility of salt in water.
        Water in air behaves much the same,
        both invisible to the naked eye and having a well-defined maximum solubility.
        Humidity is a measure this amount,
        and it is a strong function of temperature.
        Warmer air has a higher solubility for water than colder air,
        with a <m>\sim 6\%</m> increase in solubility for each \SI{1}{\kelvin} increase in temperature<fn>

        </fn>.
        <xref ref="fig_relative_humidity">Figure</xref>
        shows the relationship between air temperature and water solubility.
        The blue curve shows the maximum amount of water dissolved in air,
        and defines air at 100% relative humidity.
        Relative humidity, that standard of weather forecasts,
        is just the proportion of the maximum possible water actually present in the air.
        For example,
        the red dashed line on <xref ref="fig_relative_humidity">Figure</xref> shows 50% relative humidity,
        a reasonably comfortable day.
        The orange dotted line shows 25% relative humidity,
        which most people would find uncomfortably dry.
        Note how water solubility plummets as air temperature decreases.
        As air temperature approaches \SI{-40}{\celsius}, solubility approaches 0, which means that no water vapor exists in the air.
        At these cold temperatures,
        typical of Antarctica for example, there can be no snow:
        no water can get into the air to freeze!
      </p>
      <p>
        At Earth's <m>T_{eq}</m>, (\SI{-18}{\celsius} left arrow on the figure),
        water vapor in the air is exceptionally small,
        less than a tenth of the average amount today<fn>
        To good approximation the saturation water vapor pressure is given by <m>p_{wv}=A \cdot 10^{\frac{B \cdot T}{C+T}}</m>,
        where <m>p_{wv}</m> is in\si{\pascal}, T is temperature in \si{\celsius}, and
        <m>A,\ B \ and \ C</m> are \SI{611}{\pascal}, 7.5, and \SI{237.7}{\celsius} respectively.
        Thus the ratio is <m>\frac{10^{\frac{B \cdot T_{eq}}{C+T_{eq}}}}{10^{\frac{B \cdot T_{av}}{C+T_{av}}}}\sim 11.5</m>
        </fn>.
        This poses a problem.
        If water is responsible for over half of the greenhouse effect,
        how did it get into the air in the first place?
        Wouldn't temperatures be too cold to get any water into the air?
        Enter the non-condensable gasses.
        As <xref ref="tab_ghgconcs">Table</xref> shows
        (bottom row)
        carbon dioxide,
        methane and nitrous oxide have condensation temperatures far colder than Earth's <m>T_{eq}</m>.
        Those gasses remain in the atmosphere regardless of surface temperature,
        and produce a sufficient greenhouse effect to get
        <em>some</em> water vapor into the air
        (<xref ref="fig_wvco2">Figure</xref>).
        This in turn increases the greenhouse effect,
        raising the temperature even more.
        This positive feedback loop,
        sketched in <xref ref="fig_wvco2">Figure</xref>
        is a fundamental and crucial mechanism in the maintenance of Earth's climate.

      <title>And a powerful feedback it is</title>
      <p>
        Think of carbon dioxide as Earth's thermostat, a wonderful term<fn>
        The first use of which I can find is Oestreicher, D. (1973).
        <em>Growing, Crowding Population Hiking Earth's Thermostat</em>.
        Detroit Free Press, Tuesday, June, 12(1), 973.
        </fn> that evocatively summarizes the importance of carbon dioxide to climate, society,
        and this book.
        Thermostats don't heat or cool a room,
        they merely control the mechanism that does.
        So too with carbon dioxide and the other non-condensable greenhouse gasses we discussed,
        which control the greenhouse effect through the water vapor feedback.
        Ideally we would conduct careful,
        controlled experiments on this relationship,
        but of course this is impossible.
        To do a controlled experiment,
        as might be done in chemistry or biology,
        you need to prepare at least two identical systems.
        One system is left unchanged and acts as a control,
        a measure of the normal behavior of the system.
        The other systems are then modified,
        and the difference between the control and experimental systems reveals the effects of the modifications.
        Earth sciences are unique in that such controlled experiments are often impossible:
        we have, after all, only one Earth.
        Earth scientists often result to using natural experiments to understand how Earth works.
        Over Earth's history <m>[CO_2]_{atm}</m> has varied from 1000s to perhaps 200 ppm,
        and that enormous range has been accompanied by equally enormous changes in surface temperatures.
        These natural experiments confirm the strength of the water vapor feedback,
        but don't provide a precise view of the relationship between
        <m>[CO_2]_{atm}</m> and the average surface temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past 250 years, we have been conducting a real,
        but uncontrolled,
        experiment on the relationship between
        <m>[CO_2]_{atm}</m> and the average surface temperature., by increasing GHG concentrations by about 80%. The resulting global warming provides clear evidence of the water vapor feedback,
        but using this relationship seems premature.
        Fortunately there is another way.
        A third and powerful technique for understanding how carbon dioxide drives climate is to use computer models.
        Such models range from simple ones using a single mathematical approximation to global models using over half a million points at dozens of levels in atmosphere and ocean,
        connected by thousands of mathematical relationships.
        The strength of these models is the ability to do exactly the controlled experiments we can't do on the real Earth.
        In a computer model, changing the concentration of a gas,
        or the albedo of a continent, is straightforward,
        although determining the accuracy of the results is not.
        In a beautiful example of the usefulness and power of this method,

      <title>Why water vapor is a response, not a driver, of global climate change</title>
      <p>
        <xref ref="fig_noco2earth">Figure</xref> shows the remarkable results,
        with colors showing the average annual temperatures at each latitude.
        Areas in reds and yellows have average annual temperatures above freezing;
        areas in blues have annual temperatures below freezing.
        Results to the left of
        <q>0</q>
        time nicely reproduce actual global temperatures.
        As soon as condensable gasses are removed at 0 years,
        surface temperatures plummet, quickly,
        globally, and solely because carbon dioxide is gone.
        Average global temperatures decrease by about what you should expect: \SI{35}{\celsius} (<m>63^{\circ}</m>F), and do so with a half-life of just 3.5 years.
        In the first 3.5 years,
        this model predicts that global temperatures would decrease by \SI{17}{\celsius} (<m>31^{\circ}</m>F), or roughly \SI{5}{\celsius} (<m>9^{\circ}</m>F) per year!
        Water vapor may be the most important of the greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere,
        but it holds that position only at the invitation of the other,
        non-condensable, greenhouse gasses, like carbon dioxide.
        As suggested by the box model in <xref ref="fig_wvco2">Figure</xref>,
        and confirmed in the computer models illustrated in <xref ref="fig_noco2earth">Figure</xref>,
        water vapor in our atmosphere is a <em>response</em>,
        not a driver, of global climate change.
        This is a topic to which we will return:
        as you can imagine,
        increase in atmospheric water vapor will propagate into changes in precipitation and water supply as well.

    <title>How a tiny bit of human-emitted <m>CO_2</m> can change a planet's temperature</title>
    <p>
      Typically people do not use huge blocks of ice or open fires to change the temperature of a room.
      True, you might open a window,
      but most of us live in buildings where the temperature is controlled by a thermostat,
      sitting quietly in a corner of the room.
      One merely flicks a button,
      and the (now) computer-controlled thermostat will send signals to the heating or cooling system of the building,
      which heats or cools air which is subsequently blown into the room.
      Remarkably little energy is expended by you in the act of changing the room's temperature.
      The thermostat acts as a (metaphorical) lever,
      magnifying the forces you exert into room-wide changes in climate.
      Anthropic release of carbon dioxide works in precisely the same way.
      Because of its power as a greenhouse gas,
      carbon dioxide and other gasses we emit into the atmosphere directly change Earth's surface temperature.
      But these effects are leveraged by the
      <m>CO_2-H_2O</m> feedback into even larger changes,
      changes which have led to a roughly \SI[separate-uncertainty]{0.92(6)}{\celsius} (<m>1.7^{\circ}</m>F) increase in global surface temperatures<fn>

      we need to have a baseline from which we can measure and understand differences and changes in climate.

      why the Tropics are hot and the Poles are cold.
