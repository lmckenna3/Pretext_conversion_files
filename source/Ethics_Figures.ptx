    <caption>The simple but powerful
    <q>Circular Flow</q>
    model of economic activity. In this model, economic activity centers on households, which can be individuals, nuclear families, multiple families, or even unrelated people, who sharing living costs and space (US Census Bureau, . Households provide labor and human capital to business firms (lower red arrow), in return
    <url href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045216/00">link</url>,
    accessed 3 March 2017) for which firms pay wages and other income (lower green arrow). Households use these wages to purchase (upper green arrow) goods and services from other firms (upper red arrow), completing the circular flow of the economy. But this model in incomplete: both households and firms require input of raw materials (food, water, metals, energy, and so on) from Earth's natural resources to fuel the inner economic circles (blue arrows). The hinterlands that supply these natural resources are an important source of natural capital to the world's economy. Like human capital, they have economic value, even if that value is hard to precisely quantify. As you know from taking out your households trash, flushing a toilet, or watching smoke rise from a smokestack, all households and firms generate waste (gray arrows). This waste is generally expelled back into the environment, often into the hydrosphere and atmosphere. Natural recycling can move these waste products back in to the biosphere and geosphere (dashed gray line), while anthropic recycling can intercept the movement of waste back in to the environment.</caption>

    <caption>Resource use leads inevitably to  discharge of wastes. A coal-fired power plant, such as this coal-fired electrical generating plant in northern Illinois, requires input of coal, delivered by train or barge. The desired output of burning the coal is electricity (transported by the high-voltage wires on the towers in the background). But combustion also includes the generation of soot, ash, and gasseous by products, some of which are emitted into the atmosphere by the smoke stack in the right background. The wide tower on the far right uses water from Lake Michigan as a coolant; the steam rising from this tower is relatively clean, but does carry significant waste heat lost to the environment.

    a place to put waste products of some activity. The trash barrel is finite in extent, so its use is a zero-sum game: the more you use, the less any one else can use. (Clearly the barrels shown here were far <em>too</em> finite.) The barrels are freely available for all to use, so excluding anyone from depositing trash is difficult, even when the resource is completely full! These two characteristics<mdash/>finite size and low excludability<mdash/>are the defining characteristics of common property resources. Unfortunately, the overuse of the resource, as seen here, is all too common. Image courtesy of NOAA,

(The weight is the amount caught in a given year, divided by the maximum ever caught, and is shown as a percentage.) Cod landings peaked in the early 1990s, and then declined exponentially and catastrophically to essentially 0. Cod fishing in Maine is effectively extinct. This crash was due to a variety of causes, including poor governance of the resource (which contributed to over-fishing) and climate change. The fate of cod exemplify the <em>Tragedy of the Commons</em>, the destruction of a resource from users choosing short-term gain over long-term sustainability. The lobster fishery is still going strong, although there is some evidence that climate change is eroding lobster habitats. The lobster fishery in Maine is an excellent example of a common property resource that has avoided the Tragedy of the Commons through robust governance by fishers, communities, local, state and Federal governments.

Panel A (left) shows the relative frequency of the different types with the black dashed line, with cooperativeness increasing to the right. Altruists initiate cooperation regardless of others' actions, while free-loaders cooperate only with punishment. In the middle are those who cooperate on the provision that others do, and those whose cooperation is conditional on the elimination of free-loaders. Societies solve the collective action dilemma when their rules and behaviors increase the proportion of conditional cooperators over time, as shown by the blue, solid line. In societies where free-loaders are too common, or where rules and behaviors allow free-loaders to increase, tend to spiral into the Tragedy of the Common (dash-dot red line)(Vollan, B., &amp; Ostrom, E. (2010). Cooperation and  the Commons. Science, 330(6006), 923-924. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1198347). These fates are schematically shown in Panel B, on the right, with more cooperation leading to long-term success, and less leading to, well, less.

This is the center of our moral

But did you then take a moment and think about what to do? If so, you have felt the affective message emerge and then shaped it by cognitive thought (Buss, D. (2012).

    <caption>https://www.flickr.com/photos/estherfotografeert/236212800/in/photostream/ Reciprocal altruism is an essential social activity performed by many primates, including these bonobos (a the sister species of the common chimpanzee). Here a dominant female (on the right) shares food with a subordinate female the left). Primates, with their relatively long life spans, penchant for living in small groups, and well-developed ability to identify and remember other individuals, make primates particularly pre-disposed to altruism (Trivers, R. L. (1971). The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism. The Quarterly Review of Biology, 46(1), 35-57. https://doi.org/10.1086/406755). Even though food sharing looks like a simple short-term exchange, each cycle is a successful round of the
    <q>prisoner's dillemma</q>
    game. Evidence indicates that food sharing, grooming and other short-term practices add up to significant long-term reputation between the individuals (Jaeggi, A. V., De Groot, E., Stevens, J. M. G., &amp; Van Schaik, C. P. (2013). Mechanisms of reciprocity in primates: testing for short-term contingency of grooming and food sharing in bonobos and chimpanzees.

The reputation an individual has with family and close kin is generally more important to the individual than their reputation with more distant (geographically, culturally, or otherwise) communities. Like onions and ogres, human's ethical behavior is layered, with closer layers (communities) receiving more ethical standing. As noted by generations of philosophers, humans ethical and
    <q>moral duties and obligations are generated by our community memberships...which are multiple and`` layered (Callicott, J. B. (2014). Thinking like a planet: The land ethic and the earth ethic. Oxford University Press.). As our opinion of who is ``close</q>

Individuals who see nature as providing goods and services to humans see the natural world as having instrumental value: Nature for humans. Those who see the natural world as providing personally or culturally-important meaning to them respond to a relational values: Nature and humans. Finally, those who think the natural world has inherent worth, independent of human needs or wants. This intrinsic value system n=might be labeled: Nature for Nature. Where does your combination of values plot on this diagram? Each vertex represents a single value, where you'd be on the diagram if you thought the natural world had only, say, instrumental value. But if you enjoy the beauty of a sunset, the wash of waves at a beach, or even the smell of freshly-mowed grass, then you also find relational value in the natural world.</caption>
