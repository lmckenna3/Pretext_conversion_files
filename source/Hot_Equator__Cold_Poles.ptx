      <title>Two important characteristic temperatures</title>
      <p>
        In the Chapters and Sections above we found that we could predict an equilibrium temperature for the Earth as a whole using the Stefan-Boltzman Law,
        finding <m>T_{eq}=\SI{255}{\kelvin} = \SI{-18}{\kelvin}= -1^{\circ}F</m>.
        This temperature is a manifestation of the proportion of the Sun's insolation<mdash/>short wave radiation<mdash/>absorbed by Earth.
        We realized this temperature was far lower than Earth's actual surface temperature,
        and discovered (Equation 4.04) that the Greenhouse Effect raises Earth's average global temperature to <m>T_{av}=\SI{288}{\kelvin} = \SI{15}{\kelvin}= 60^{\circ}F</m>.
        This change was due to the interrupted flow of heat<mdash/>as long wave radiation<mdash/>from Earth to space by greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere.
        As you might have guessed, these two temperatures,
        important as they are, are insufficient to describe Earth's climate.
        Unless you live in a sealed, air conditioned room,
        you know that there are seasonal and diurnal variations in temperature at one place,
        as well as temperature variations at the same time from place to place.
        These temporal and spatial variations are due to temporal and spatial variations in the amount of energy received and absorbed by Earth;
        understanding their origin and scale will prepare us for understanding the crucial role the atmosphere and oceans play in transporting heat and moderating climate across the globe.

      <title>A brief geographical interlude: latitude and longitude</title>
      <p>
        Understanding Earth's climate requires that we understand Earth's natural directions and geography.
        As a rotating sphere, Earth naturally has two Poles, North and South,
        and an Equator half-way between.
        <xref ref="fig_globe">Figure</xref>
        is a map of the Earth in Robinson projection,
        which nicely presents all parts of the globe with relatively little distortion,
        except near the poles.
        On the Robinson projection, the North and South Poles,
        which are really points,
        are spread into the upper and lower blues lines on the map.
        Lines of latitude are actually circles
        (shown in blue),
        parallel to the Equator and indicate the angle from the equator to the given parallel of latitude measured north or south of the Equator.
        The contiguous 48 states of the United States fall, for example,
        between <m>\ang{49.5}</m> N and
        <m>\ang{24.5}</m>N, although Alaska and Hawaii are respectively much further north and south of these limits.
        The North and South Poles are at latitudes <m>\ang{90}</m>N and
        <m>\ang{90}</m>S, and the Equator is at <m>\ang{0}</m>.
        A number of parallels have significant climatological and cultural significance,
        and are shown and labeled on the map.

        Establishing an east-west coordinate system is more difficult;
        lines of longitude run from pole to pole,
        but one such line is no more natural a starting point than another.
        By international agreement,
        one fraught with intrigue and mathematics, 25 nations decided somewhat arbitrarily in 1884 CE to set the line of longitude running through a particular telescope at the Greenwich Observatory,
        near London, England, as the starting point for longitude<fn>

        Longitudes increase from <m>\ang{0}</m> to
        <m>\ang{180}</m>E eastward from London,
        and from <m>\ang{0}</m> to
        <m>\ang{180}</m>W to the west of London.
        The contiguous United States fall between
        <m>\ang{67}</m>W (West Quoddy Head, Maine) and
        <m>\ang{125}</m> W (Cape Alava, Washington).

      <q>Latitudes however, are more significant for the diversity of lands than longitudes</q>

        In terms of locating a place on Earth,
        latitude and longitude are equal.
        Not so in terms of climate.
        Over 2500 years ago, the Greek philosopher Parmenides<fn>
        G&#xf3;mez, N. W. (2008).
        The tropics of empire: why Columbus sailed south to the Indies.
        Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, pg. 72
        </fn> was aware that climate varied more by latitude than by longitude,
        an observation best summarized by the great Muslim polymath Averro{\:e}s (1126-1198 CE) in the quote opening this section<fn>
        Ibid, pg. 1
        </fn>.
        Directions on Earth are climatologicaly important.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parmenides called areas of similar latitude <em>zones</em>,
        and so east-west directions and averages are termed <em>zonal</em>,
        as shown on <xref ref="fig_globe">Figure</xref>.
        For the subsequent 25 centuries western science has divided Earth into 5 major zones,
        symmetric to the Equator.
        They are labeled in bold letters on the map:
        two Polar zones, two Temperate zones,
        and a single Tropical zone.
        Parmenides, and a long train of geographers after him,
        used the Sun's apparent position at key seasonal points to define the boundaries.
        In the polar zones, the Sun does not rise at least one day per year,
        and does not set at least one day per year.
        The Arctic and Antarctic circles
        (dashed lines at <m>\ang{66.6}</m> N and S)
        mark the equator-ward extent of these areas.
        In the Tropics,
        the Sun passes directly overhead at least one day during the year.
        The Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn
        (dashed lines at <m>\ang{23.4}</m>N and S)
        bound the Tropics.
        Precise latitudes for the climatological boundaries between the zones are neither necessary nor possible,
        but if you have to have a number,
        choose <m>\ang{30}</m> and
        <m>\ang{60}</m>, N and S, for the climatological boundaries between the zones.
        These aren't the traditional boundaries identified by Parmenides,
        but as we'll see they reflect the actual behavior of Earth's climate system better than the solar boundaries.
        The other direction,
        parallel to lines of longitude, is termed meridional,
        after meridian, another name for a line of longitude.
        <xref ref="fig_Apollo17">Figure</xref>
        shows the zonal nature of climate nicely.

      <title>The power of ignoring detail</title>
      <p>
        Semester grades at most colleges and universities are based on some form of average,
        typically an average over time and over different types of assignments.
        That average grade is a remarkably compact number,
        summarizing an entire semester's worth of last minute cramming and late night writing into a single number or letter.
        Averages eliminate the need to slog through every grade on every quiz and homework;
        they illustrate the big picture without the distraction of detail.
        Climate is a
        <q>big picture</q>
        view of average weather over time.
        This time scale varies, but for the purposes of our studies,
        climate is generally considered to be the average over multiple decades,
        and very often 30 years.
        This averaging removes the
        (sometimes interesting)
        short-term detail,
        but also removes the distractions of too much detail.
        Climate can be averaged over space, as well as time.
        Zonal averages,
        averages at a given latitude or range of latitudes,
        taken over all longitudes, will be particularly useful.
        We don't need too much detail to get a great understanding of Earth's climate.
