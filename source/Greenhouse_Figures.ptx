    <caption>The cause of the greenhouse effect, revealed by the relationship between atmospheric pressure (on the horizontal axis) and the difference between actual surface temperature and the blackbody equilibrium temperature (vertical axis). On the left is a graph with standard arithmetic axes: each tick mark is a fixed amount greater than the previous. This type of graph can't show the often enormous range of values typical in studying climate. The log-log graph on the right has a constant factor between tick marks. Each one is 10 times larger than the previous. These axes expand the lower left corner of a typical graph, and reveal that pressure and temperature difference are closely related.</caption>

The three gasses making up 99% of the (dry) atmosphere (Nitrogen gas, <m>N_2</m>; oxygen gas, <m>O_2</m>, and argon <m>Ar</m>) have one or two atoms.

    <caption>Earth's energy balance in three easy pieces. Piece 1: Over the long term, Earth must emit as much energy as it receives from the Sun. On average, each square meter of Earth's surface receives energy at a rate of \SI{340}{\watt}. Some of this energy is reflected back to space, a proportion called Earth's albedo, A. Earth must emit the rest of the energy, \SI{340}{\watt}, back to space. This amount of energy corresponds to a <m>T_{eq} = \SI{255}{\kelvin}=\SI{-18}{\celsius}=-1^{\circ}</m>F.</caption>

Hotter objects emit more energy than cooler ones, so Earth's surface must emit more energy than it receives from the Sun alone! How is this possible? The Greenhouse Effect.</caption>

  <figure xml:id="fig_erb_c">
    <caption>Step 3: The solution is that each square meter of Earth's surface receives \SI{326}{\watt} of energy re-emitted from the atmosphere (the large red arrow on the right of the diagram). This energy comes from energy absorbed by the clouds and atmosphere directly from the Sun (the yellow arrow labeled
    <q>absorbed</q>),
    from energy contained in thermals of rising air (think cumulus clouds) and from water evaporation and plant growth (evapotranspiration, in green), and from the surface itself. Earth's surface absorbs more energy from the atmosphere than from the Sun!</caption>

  <figure xml:id="fig_sun_earth_spectrum">
    <caption>The Sun's and Earth's spectra and the origin of the greenhouse effect. The lowest panel shows the important bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, with short wavelength ultra-violet to the left, visible in teh middle, and long-wavelength infra-red on the right. Note the log scale on the wavelength axis. The middle panel shows the relative amount of energy emitted at each wavelength by the Sun (in yellow) and Earth (in red). The gray shading indicates how effectively Earth's atmosphere absorbs or scatters light of each wavelength. The lower the gray line, the more transparent the atmosphere is to that color of light. Portions of the spectrum (for example, most of the infra-red with wavelengths above \SI{10,000}{\nano\metre}) where the gray fill extends to
    <q>0 transmission</q>
    indicates total absorption by the atmosphere. Light of that wavelength never makes it through the atmosphere, in <em>or</em> out. Portions (such as the visible band) where the atmosphere is transparent to light are called
    <q>windows</q>. By cosmic coincidence, the Sun's peak insolation exactly overlaps a big, wide window in the atmosphere. Earth, on the other hand, emits infra-red radiation that is largely absorbed, except for the narrow window right at \SI{10,000}{\nano\metre}. The upper panel identifies the greenhouse gasses responsible for absorption features. Note that water vapor is a strong absorber of infra-red radiation, and causes the spikes of absorbance all through the infra-red. Note how water and carbon dioxide conspire to make the atmosphere around Earth's peak emission relatively opaque. This traps the light and its energy in in the atmosphere, warming it and causing the greenhouse effect.</caption>

    <caption>Seeing the sky for the trees and emission heights in the atmosphere. In Panel A (upper), you stand within a dense forest, and the trunks effectively block your ability to see the horizon. Greenhouse gas molecules in the atmosphere act like trees in a forest, preventing infra-red light from
    <q>seeing</q>
    space. But in Panel B (lower) you are standing at the edge of the forest, and there are so few tree trunks between you and the forest's edge you can see the horizon. Analogously, in Earth's atmosphere infra-red light can only escape when there relatively few greenhouse gas molecules left left to run into. This is the emission height of the atmosphere.</caption>

  <figure xml:id="fig_emission_heights">
    <caption>Seeing through the forest, as applied to Earth's atmosphere. The line shows the typical height at which light (of the wavelength given on the horizontal axis, on a log scale to easily compare with <xref ref="fig_sun_earth_spectrum">Figure</xref>) reaches space without further absorption in Earth's atmosphere. The global average for all infra-red light is around \SI{5.5}{\kilo\metre}, although for the atmosphere modeled here, this height is closer to \SI{6.6}{\kilo\metre}, about 22,000 feet. This is about half the typical flight level of a large passenger jet. The peak at \SI{15,000}{\nano\metre} is due to <m>CO_2</m>, and the height of this emission (\SI{11}{\kilo\metre}, about 36,000 feet) is at the flight level of that same jet. Note how the emission height shown here is qualitatively the same as the transmission of the atmosphere depicted in the central panel of <xref ref="fig_sun_earth_spectrum">Figure</xref>.</caption>

Brown to black areas are quite dry, with low concentrations of water vapor, while areas colored white to blue have increasingly higher concentrations of water vapor. In Panel B (on the right) is a visible light image taken at the same time, showing just clouds. Note how water vapor is present in areas where clouds are not, indicating the water vapor really is dissolved in the air, and not (in most places) forming clouds.

  <figure xml:id="fig_feedback_loops_intro">
    <caption>Systems can act in complicated ways when their parts interact. One important class of interactions are feedbacks, where change in one part of a system produces change in another. Panel A (upper left) shows a competitive collegiate wrestler whose weight must stay within a narrow target range. If the wrestler's weight increases or decreases, the wrestler decreases or increases respectively their calorie intake. Such <em>negative</em> signals, shown by the red dashed line connecting the two parts of the system, reflect the opposite signs of the changes. An increase or decrease in caloric intake leads to weight increase of decrease respectively, a positive signal (shown by the solid green line). Systems, such as the wrestler, with an odd number of negative signals are negative feedback systems: over time, small changes in the system get squashed and the system tends to stay in steady state (Panel C, green solid line). Systems with no or an even number of negative signals are positive loops (Panel B, upper right). Over time, small changes in the system get amplified and the system tends to diverge (sometimes catastrophically) from steady state. Earth's climate, stable for billions of years, is a negative feedback system. But anthropogenic signals, from greenhouse gas emissions to use of fertilizers to land use change, are pushing the climate into new realms.</caption>

    <caption>This view of the Schmidt Hills of Antarctica, shows the frozen Polar Plateau leading
    off to the Ronne Ice Shelf in the background. All that ice is nothing more than compacted snow, but
    to the surprise of most people, snow in Antarctica is actually pretty rare, simply because the Antarctic air
    is too cold to hold much water. Antarctica is a unique and spectacular part of planet Earth, but
    much of the planet's surface would look like the landscape there if it weren't for the effects
    of carbon dioxide as a non-condensable gas: a gas that doesn't freeze to a solid on the surface.</caption>

  <figure xml:id="fig_relative_humidity">
    <caption>Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas in our atmosphere, but the amount of water in the atmosphere is a strong function of temperature. Humidity, which measures the amount of water in air, increases by about 6% for every \SI{1}{\kelvin} increase in temperature, as shown by the solid blue line. As air cools, the humidity drops so fast that substantial snow falls are essentially impossible. The blue solid line gives the maximum humidity possible, while the red dashed line and orange dotted lines show relative humidities (RH) of 50% and 25%. Typical relative humidities [Citation here] in Hawai'i are 70% to 50%, in Arizona 50% to 25%. Most people feel pretty comfortable at of 50% RH, but uncomfortably wet at 75% RH and uncomfortably dry at 25% RH. Since 1750 AD, average surface temperatures have increased by about \SI{1}{\kelvin}, increasing water vapor concentrations by <m>\sim 6%</m>. In one of the most graphic signs of climate change, this has increased the likelihood of heavy rains in both tropical [Donat, M. G. Ang&#xe9;lil and Ukkola, A. M. (2019) Intensification of precipitation extremes in the world's humid and water-limited regions.

  <figure xml:id="fig_wvco2">
    <caption>The positive feedback loop involving carbon dioxide, water vapor and the greenhouse effect plays a key role in moderating Earth's climate. Even at Earth's cold equilibrium temperature, the three greenhouse gasses other than water vapor<mdash/>carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide<mdash/>all remain gasses in the atmosphere. These non-condensable gasses (Box 1) increase the greenhouse effect (Box 2) which in turn increases the surface temperature of the planet (Box 3). This leads to an increase in the maximum humidity of the atmosphere (Box 4), and hence the evaporation of water (Box 5), and hence more water vapor in the atmosphere (Box 6). This, finally, leads to another increase in the greenhouse effect (back to Box 2), and the loop repeats. Because there are only positive signals in this system, this is a positive feedback loop.</caption>

    <caption>The results of a computer model demonstrates how carbon dioxide and other
    <q>non-condensable</q>
    gasses control Earth's greenhouse effect. Colors indicate (see the scale on the bottom of the image) the average annual mean surface temperature for each latitude. The researchers removed all the <m>CO_2,\ CH_4\ and\ N_2O</m> from the modeled atmosphere at year
    <q>0,</q>
    and then ran the model forward. Within 10 years of the digital removal, the model predicts drastic changes in climate. Without <m>CO_2</m> and other non-condensable gasses, the atmosphere cools so much that little water vapor remains in the atmosphere. Due to the water vapor<mdash/>carbon dioxide feedback loop (<xref ref="fig_wvco2">Figure</xref>), this lowers the greenhouse effect, lowers the surface temperature and lowers the humidity even father. Only 50 years after the experiment begins, average surface temperatures have dropped \SI{35}{\kelvin}, almost half the ocean is covered in ice, and Earth has an albedo of 0.42 (which acts to coll the planet even more). Ice occurs at sea level in the oceans except the narrow band (indicated in yellow) north of the equator. Figure is courtesy of NASA.</caption>

    <q>a diagram showing general arrangement, but without a consistent scale,</q>
    and that certainly applies to this diagram. At the scale of the Earth shown in the diagram, the Sun would be 25 feet across and almost 3800 feet away from the model Earth! Polaris-the North Star-is about 430 light years away.To put Polaris at the correct distance from our model Earth, we'd need a sheet of paper that extends beyond the orbit of Pluto! Let's accept these distortions for now. Earth spins a full <m>\ang{360}</m> relative to the Sun on it's axis once every 24 hours. Over the course of a year, Earth orbits the sun in our
    <q>orbital plane</q>
    shown by the dashed green line. Earth's axis is titled <m>\ang{23.4}</m> relative to its orbital plane; this <em>obliquity</em> is why Earth has seasons. Because Earth is a sphere, some portions of the Earth face the Sun directly during some part of the day; others face away from the Sun for the entire day. The solid blue lines show equal amounts of solar energy (think of them as
    <q>tubes</q>
    ) from the Sun hitting Earth. The tube of energy falling on Africa is concentrated over a small area, shown by the blue rectangle, and hence leads to higher temperatures. The same energy is spread over a much larger area in the lower tube, leading to cooler temperatures. This is one of the reasons the Tropics are warm and the Poles cold.</caption>

The arrow shows the orientation of Earth's rotation, spinning around the North Pole and pointing toward Polaris. As in Figure {fig:season1}, the scale here is wildly wrong. The constant direction of the arrow reminds us that Earth's orientation in space is effectively fixed over the year. The lower panel shows that Earth's obliquity causes seasonal differences in the directness of insolation from the Sun. Summer happens when a hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, increasing the intensity and duration of solar radiation. The increased heating leads to warmer temperatures.

The solid green line is the observed average surface temperature, <m>T_{observed}</m>, which clearly changes with latitude, colder at the poles, warmer in the tropics, as we'd expect. The blue dot-dash line, <m>T_{calculated}</m>, is the zonal average temperature one calculates from zonal insolation and albedo, as shown in <xref ref="eq_Tlat1">Equation</xref>, and is clearly does a terrible job estimating Earth's actual surface temperatures (green). Adding the greenhouse effect in helps, this is shown by the dashed red line labeled <m>T_{observed, GHE}</m>. This is a pretty good model, a little too warm in the tropics and a little too cool in the poles, but the overall agreement is good. We clearly understand the basic forces controlling Earth's average surface temperatures. But our model doesn't include a crucial element, the flow of heat from the warm tropics to the cooler pole.
