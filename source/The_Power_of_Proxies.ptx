  <title>Measuring past climates: the power of proxies and programs</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Understanding recent climate changes requires precise and accurate estimates of surface temperature,
      insolation,
      albedo and atmospheric composition over those same times.
      There are few to no such measurements at all until the beginning of the Enlightenment Period (<nbsp/>1650 CE), and only since 1900 CE or so has a global network of weather stations been measuring temperatures.
      We need stand-ins,
      something we can measure now that precisely and accurately records both the climatic conditions and the age of past environments.
      These climate <em>proxies</em> are
      <q>stand-ins</q>
      for actual measurements of past climate.
      A good climate proxy can be as seemingly simple as the width of tree rings.
      Careful counting of tree rings establishes their age,
      while their width is a proxy for temperature and precipitation at the time of growth.

      </fn> is a physical, chemical and biological
      <q>record that correlates reasonably well to a climate variable,
      and that researchers can take reliable high-resolution measurements of that record and calibrate them against modern instrumental measurements.</q>
      Paleo-climatologists use a wide variety of records as proxies,
      including those as familiar as tree-rings;
      as standard as isotopic ratios of stable elements in ice cores, corals,
      speleothems<fn>
      the general terms for stalagmites and stalactites,
      deposits formed in caves from minerals dissolved in water
      </fn>,
      and as obscure as the relative proportion of fatty molecules containing 86 carbon atoms made by a particular marine prokaryote<fn>

      http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2007.12.010.
      </fn>.
      The most common proxies for paleoclimatology are listed in <xref ref="tab_proxies">table</xref>.
      All of them share three components.
      Each has a relatively tough physical substance that holds the record,
      and might be sediment, ice, wood, or rock.
      All proxies have some way of accumulating the substance in layers that allow the age of the substance to be calculated.
      For example, in glaciers and trees,
      annual variations in snow fall and tree growth lead to annual layering,
      while in sediments variations in Earth's orbit might produce layers spanning hundreds of thousands of years<fn>

      </fn>.
      Finally, there must be something in the record that is sensitive to climatological aspects,
      the proxy itself.
      Glacial ice contains sulphate compounds,
      which reflect the volume of volcanic eruptions,
      while the relative abundance of different species of single-celled foraminifera reflect the temperature and salinity of the oceans in which they grew.
      Stable isotope ratios in those same shells are also good proxies for water temperature and acidity,
      and can even constrain the mass of ice on the continents.

    <p>
      The power of proxies rests on their ability to constrain the climate at a certain point in the past.
      For ice cores and rings from living trees,
      finding the age of a proxy is as straightforward as counting annual layers,
      although the inevitable complexities of nature lead to errors of 1-2% in the ages<fn>

      </fn>.
      Sediments, speleothems and corals are typically dated radiometrically,
      using the decay of radioactive isotopes measured in the samples to date a few key horizons,
      and then assuming a constant rate of formation between the dated horizons<fn>
      for one of thousands of examples of this,
      see Zhang, P., Cheng, H., Edwards, R. L., Chen, F., Wang, Y., Yang, X., ... &amp; An, C. (2008).

      Is uniformitarianism necessary?. American journal of science, 263(3), 223-228 as a persuasive counter to such assumptions.
      </fn> Regardless of how a record is dated,
      the accuracy of the age is generally inversely proportional to the age,
      so as the age increases, so too does the uncertainty in that age.
      Natural processes tend to
      <q>smear</q>
      proxies across their record as well,
      which essentially averages a proxy signal over many time periods.

    <title>How we know
    <q>where:</q>
    field work</title>
    <p>
      The final facet of proxies we need to consider is their location,
      their place.
      For some proxy records, location is straight forward:
      a tree ring clearly must be from the place the tree grew.
      But in other cases, place is not so straightforward.
      Most sediment cores are collected from the sea floor.
      As we learned in Chapter 6, tectonic plates are constantly on the move,
      so sediments even a few million years old have moved since they were deposited.
      The climate signals recorded in speleothems reflect the average climate conditions over a large area proximate to the cave in which it is found,
      not just at the cave itself.
      Regardless of the area over which a proxy record records climate,
      scientists still need to get into the field to collect it.
      Field work is for many scientists a great joy of the job,
      even though it's often exhausting,
      filthy and occasionally dangerous work.
      Despite the travails, being
      <q>in the field</q>
      allows scientists to determine the setting and regional context of the record they are extracting from nature.
      Even cursory visual inspection in the field of an ice core,
      coral sample, or tree section can reveal interruptions,
      damage or alteration that reduce the sample's utility,
      allowing collection of additional samples.

    <title>How we test hypotheses: models</title>
    <p>
      Dr.
      Wubbo Octels was a physicist,
      astronaut and keen observer of our planet<fn>
      http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Astronauts/Wubbo_J._Ockels,
      assessed 10 December 2018
      </fn> who once noted that
      <q>There's only one earth.
      And there's no spare.</q>
      While Octels meant that statement to be a call to environmental action,
      it is also a cause to pause for a moment and ask how climatologists can do hypothesis-driven science if we only have one climate.
      You probably learned in high school or college classes that science good science involves studies with control runs and experimental runs,
      all rigidly testing single hypotheses.
      Real science doesn't run like that,
      particularly in the sciences (geology, meteorology, astronomy,
      evolution) that study enormous,
      complicated, or extinct systems.
      In these fields, we turn to <em>natural experiments</em>
      provided by nature to test hypotheses<fn>

      We have, fortunately, no way of generating tornadoes;
      instead meteorologists use their natural occurrence over time and space to test hypotheses about their formation and behavior<fn>

      As we'll see below,
      the last 65 My of Earth's history provides exactly these kinds of natural experiments,
      which is why understanding Earth's past behavior is crucial to understanding soon-to-be climates.
      After all, we <em>are</em> unintentionally running an experiment with climate:
      for 250 years we've been pumping greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere,
      and climate has in fact changed.
      But how can we be sure this correlation involves cause,
      and not coincidence?

      Enter computer models, which attempt to approximate those enormous,
      complicated systems with mathematics.
      Some models are quite simple,
      doable with pencil and paper.
      Arguably the very first climate model was done in 1896 by Sweedish chemist Svante Arrhenius<fn>
      Wearth, Spencer.

      who with pencil and paper correctly predicted that doubling the atmospheric concentration of <m>CO_2</m> would raise average surface temperatures by \SIrange{5}{6}{\celsius}
      (<m>9-11 ^\circ\,F</m>).
      Arrhenius's work demonstrated the key aspect of climate models:
      use math to approximate the physics driving climate,
      and then change some part of the system and watch what happens to the rest.
      Energy balance models are a bit more complicated,
      using incoming and outgoing radiation,
      greenhouse gas concentrations and albedo to predict surface and atmospheric temperatures.
      You used just such a model in Chapter 4 to calculate Earth's average surface temperature for a variety of conditions!

      </fn> of land, oceans,
      atmosphere and cryosphere to the model.
      More accurate are Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models,
      which can resolve movement in the ocean and atmosphere,
      so provide insight into how the circulation of the spheres change over time.
      These complex models divide the atmosphere and ocean into cells,
      typically 100 km across and a few hundred meters thick
      (<xref ref="modelgrid">Figure</xref>).
      AOGCMs are accurate for seasonal to decadal time scales<fn>
      IPCC AR5, Chapter 9, section 9.1.2.1
      </fn>,
      because they lack an important part of the climate:
      feed backs between the spheres and the cycles of the elements,
      particularly the carbon cycle.
      Earth System Models do just this,
      incorporating an array of feedback processes in the models.
      If you or a friend have used gaming consoles,
      you are aware how games' complexity and realism grows as computers get faster and more powerful.
      So too with climate models,
      the most complex of which require hours-long runs on supercomputers
      (<xref ref="modelgrid">Figure</xref>).

      But the results are worth the effort:
      they are the very experimental Earths we need.
      A particularity important demonstration of the power of models is shown in <xref ref="fig_2models">Figure</xref>.
      In the upper pane,
      the actual average surface temperature is shown by the heavy black line.
      Swarming around it are light yellow lines,
      each showing the temperature produced by roughly 14 AOGCM models run 58 times,
      driven by all natural and anthropogenic forcings,
      including human-produced greenhouse gasses and pollutants.
      The scattered results are due to slight differences between the models and the data input in to them.
      One way to reduce this noise is to average the results,
      shown by the red line,
      which nicely matches the observed temperature trend,
      including the episodic, sudden,
      but brief drops in temperature caused by volcanic eruptions
      (shown by the dashed vertical lines).
      In the lower pane are 19 experiments from 5 models
      (in light blue),
      but here the anthropogenic forcings are omitted from the models.
      Note how the modeled temperatures
      (in dark blue)
      veer from actual temperatures in the early 1960s,
      with the differences increasing as the models approach the <m>21^{st}</m> Century.
      This is the power of models:
      to test hypotheses about climate's past, present and future,
      and to attribute observed changes to actual causes.
