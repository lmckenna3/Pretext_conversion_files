  <title>Elinor Ostrom and effective governance of the common</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The difference between successfully and unsuccessfully managed CPRs lies in how they are <em>governed</em>.
      Think of
      <q>governance..as the structures and processes by which [individuals] in societies make decisions and share power,
      creating the conditions for ordered rule and collective action.<fn>
      Schultz, L., Folke, C., "Osterblom, H., &amp; Olsson, P. (2015).
      Adaptive governance, ecosystem management, and natural capital.
      Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 112(24), 7369-7374
      </fn>.</q>
      The science of CPR governance was pioneered by Professor Elinor Ostrom,
      one of the winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics in 2009.
      Her work, with hundreds of colleagues and students,
      demonstrated through both field work and careful laboratory studies that successful governance strategies exist,
      and can be implemented by societies who want them.

    <p>
      So how does a collection of free-loaders, would-be cooperators,
      and the occasional altruists successfully manage a CPR? Observations of well-managed CPRs shows that the Tragedy of the Commons is
      <em>not</em> inevitable.
      Individuals in the group must eventually learn from experience that conditional cooperation<mdash/>acting with the group as long as free-loaders are punished<mdash/>leads to increased cooperation over time,
      and the long-term sustainability of the resource.
      This cooperation is begun by those rare altruists,
      but is ultimately completed by the remainder of the users,
      who enforce cooperation by preventing free-loaders from unfair gain.

    <title>Observed practices of successfully managed CPR</title>
    <p>
      These same observations show that a suite of core features are shared by these well-managed CPRs<fn>

      The struggle to govern the commons.
      Science, 302(5652), 1907-1912
      </fn>.
      Fundamental to successful governance is data on the resource:
      how much there is, how fast that amount is changing,
      how healthy the resources is,
      are crucial observations that allow the users to maintain the resource.
      Users build and maintain reputations for trustworthiness by frequent face-to-face conversations.
      For example,
      lobster fishers in Maine accomplish both these tasks simultaneously,
      often over a doughnut and coffee in the pre-dawn hours before they head out for the day.
      This communication also helps users gauge each others behavior,
      and make sure that everyone follows the rules they've agreed to.
      Well-run CPRs have efficient and low-cost ways of excluding outsiders from the resource,
      either through formal rules or informal behaviors.
      Lobstering is an intensely local activity,
      and fishers who try to place their gear in another town's waters will quickly find their gear
      <q>missing</q>
      if they continue the practice.
      Finally, and this might be out of control of a group, CPRs are easier to manage when the resource only changes slowly.
      Rapid change, as see in the cod fisheries of Maine,
      produces so much anxiety in users that free-loading becomes seductively attractive<fn>

    <title>8 Successful Strategies</title>
    <p>
      With those goals in mind, Ostrom and her co-authors found that a few good strategies were enough to bring stability to CPRs (See <xref ref="tab_8_strats">Table</xref>).
      Each of them faces unique challenges when applied to global CPRs, such as the atmosphere CPR. Below we examine each strategy,
      grouped by the practices we saw in <xref ref="practices">Section</xref>

      <title>Change is inevitable (Strategies 0, 5)</title>
      <p>
        A
        <q>panacea</q>
        is a cure-all, something that fixes all ailments.
        Unfortunately,
        there are no panaceas when it comes to governing a CPR. Strategies that work in one CPR may not work in another one,
        and strategies that work now may not work in the future.
        Because change is inevitable,
        users should be open to review of the rules and limits governing the CPR. This requires experimentation with what works,
        often repeatedly.
        Even in small CPRs this can lead to confusion and anger amongst users.
        Experimentation is hard for any CPR, but is exceptionally hard for the atmospheric CPR. We have only one planet after all,
        and experiments take decades to play out.
        So our
        <q>experiments</q>
        have to be done indirectly<mdash/>through computer simulation,
        small-scale models,
        or using Earth's past natural climate changes as natural experiences.

      <title>Build trust (Strategy 2)</title>
      <p>
        As we've seen repeatedly in this chapter,
        reputation is the key to initiating and maintaining the conditional cooperation so crucial to running a CPR. Honest,
        early and frequent communication is a key aspect of building reputation,
        trust and cooperation with in a group.
        Conflict within any group is inevitable,
        (partly because power is usually unevenly distributed between individuals),
        but having existing relationships helps to both reduce the frequency and severity of the conflicts.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <p>
      Building trust on global CPRs is triply difficult.
      Everyone, all 7 billion humans,
      use the atmosphere CPR, so we can only build trust through reputation,
      which takes time, technology and money.
      But most of us will never, meet directly.
      So we need to rely on representative
      (often political)
      leaders, many of whom have vague reputations even with their own people.
      Finally, most CPRs are small enough that users share a common culture,
      which is definitely not true for global CPRs.
      The enormous variation in cultural beliefs across the human population makes reputation building difficult.
    </p>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Collect, analyze and discuss data (Strategies 1,6)</title>
      <p>
        Having reliable data on the status of the CPR is invaluable.
        Knowing how much of the resource is left,
        how fast the amount of the resource is changing,
        and where the remaining resources are located are all as valuable as the resource itself.
        But data alone is not enough:
        the data has to be presented to users in ways they can understand and act on,
        but in enough detail to be useful.
        Finally the users of the resource need to discuss the data amongst themselves and others so they can create a proper course of action for the CPRs management.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <p>
      Applying this to climate change and the atmosphere CPR is exceptionally difficult.
      Surprisingly few people actually understand the greenhouse effect,
      and hence don't understand the causal relationship between emission of greenhouse gasses and global warming<fn>
      Just 35 words,``Earth's [surface] transforms sunlight's <em>visible</em>
      light energy into <em>infrared</em> light energy,
      which leaves Earth slowly because it is absorbed by greenhouse gases.
      When people produce greenhouse gases,
      energy leaves Earth <em>even more slowly</em><mdash/><em>raising</em>
      Earth's temperature."are enough to  get the point across,
      even to a lay audience.

      </fn>.
      No amount of data on the status of the atmosphere can help users manage it successfully if they don't understand how the CPR actually works.
      Clearly, the goal of this book is to change that!
    </p>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Infrastructure is important (Strategy 4)</title>
      <p>
        Infrastructure<ndash/>the built facilities and structures of society<mdash/>conditions what is a CPR. Something as simple as barb-wire provides a great example.
        Prior to the 1880s, the Great Plains of the United States were largely open lands,
        through which
        <q>cowmen</q>
        drove their grazing herds.
        Closing the millions of acres of land was impractical,
        and the grass remained a CPR. With the invention of barb-wire,
        enclosing vast stretches of land became possible,
        and the open prairie was rapidly fenced in.
        Barb-wire killed a CPR<fn>

        </fn>.
        Global communications and transport has allowed the flourishing of a global marketplace for resources from many CPRs:
        lobster from Maine is flown nightly to markets around the world.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Governance (Strategies 3 and 7)</title>
      <p>
        Users in well-run CPRs believe,
        often through extensive experience and experimentation,
        that the rules governing use of the resource are beneficial to them in the long-run.
        Users who have this
        <q>buy-in</q>
        are more likely to follow the rules themselves,
        and are less tolerant of free-loading in others.
        Developing this ethic is easier when there are tiered penalties for rule-breakers.
        Thus mild or initial infractions should have mild penalties,
        but subsequent or serious infractions earn more serious sanctions.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <p>
      Finally, there is how all this governance is structured.
      Research clearly indicates that CPRs fail if the only governance is from centralized,
      top-down administration through laws by national governments.
      Instead, governance is more effective when it starts at the local level with users,
      and continues to larger scales.
      These groups form a
      <q>nested</q>
      chain of institutions, all of which share management decisions,
      focused on maintaining the CPR<fn>

      rescaling political subjects.
      International Journal of the Commons, 6(2). https://doi.org/10.18352/ijc.336
      </fn>.
      The lobster fishery in Maine is governed by local fishers at the port level,
      who effectively and collectively enforce the rules on the number and type of lobster caught.
      A fisher from each local collection of ports serves on a state-sponsored
      <q>Lobster Zone Council,</q>
      which fosters communication and data sharing at the regional level.
      One person from each of these Councils also serves on the
      <q>Lobster Advisory Council,</q>
      which advises Maine's Governor,
      sponsors lobster research and resolves the inevitable disputes between ports,
      zones and regions.
      The
      <q>Atlantic States Marine Fishery Council</q>
      has a Lobster Board,
      which coordinates maintenance of lobster fisheries all along the New England coast.
      Most controversially, the
      <q>National Marine Fisheries Service</q>
      provides a Federal presence in the management.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a sprawling, apparently cumbersome structure,
      and some levels were designed specifically to prevent other levels from gaining too much power.
      But it <em>works</em>.
      Despite 70 years of intensive fishing,
      climate change, technological growth and two World Wars,
      lobster have survived as a resource,
      and lobstering has survived as a way of life.

    <title>Governing the Atmospheric CPR is more difficult than governing other CPRs</title>
    <p>
      The global scale and slow change of the atmospheric CPR means it has different features than the vast majority of other CPRs.
      These unique features make governing the atmospheric CPR uniquely difficult.
      As we saw above, Ostrom's research showed that CPRs are well-governed when the users communicate repeatedly<fn>
      Dietz, et al.
      Op.
      Cit.
      </fn> and personally with each other.
      This builds trust and reputation among the users.
      This trust allows users to escape the Prisoner's Dilemma,
      and avoid the worst-of-all-outcomes we saw in <xref ref="Prisoners_D">section</xref>.
      But the atmospheric CPR is global!
      Meeting, personally and repeatedly,
      with fellow emitters of greenhouse gasses from China, Brazil,
      or Australia is impossible.
      The only people who can meet repeatedly face to face are political entities,
      such as national governments,
      multi-national organizations (The UN), and others private entities.
      But even these meetings can be overly large,
      with well over 23,000 participants<fn>
      Carbon Brief,
      quoting offical UN documentation https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-have-sent-the-most-delegates-to-cop21, accessed 14 March 2017
      </fn> at the important 2015 Climate talks in Paris.
      Building trust and reputation is hard when you have to meet 23,000 people in a few weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another subtle difference is the slow,
      inter-generational nature of the atmospheric CPR's collapse.
      Cod fishing went from profitable to impossible in a generation.
      But the collapse of the atmospheric CPR has been happening for at least 150 years,
      and will continue for at least as long.
      In his perfectly titled essay <em>The Perfect Moral Storm</em>, Steven Gardiner<fn>
      Gardiner, S. M. (2006).
      A perfect moral storm: climate change,
      inter-generational ethics and the problem of moral corruption.
      Environmental values, 397-413.
      </fn> argues that those same political entities who met in Paris tend to act with their current
      (not future)
      citizens in mind and so ignore the interests of future citizens.
      While true, this behavior isn't relegated just to politicians.
      Most people tend to discount the needs of future people in favor of those already here;
      many individuals even tend to discount their own future needs over their current needs.
      But are you any less
      <q>valuable</q>
      in 20 years than you are now?
      This practice of discounting the future in favor of the present has always been a difficulty of managing CPRs, but it reaches new levels when applied to global CPRs such as the atmosphere's ability to hold the waste products of the Anthroposphere.
