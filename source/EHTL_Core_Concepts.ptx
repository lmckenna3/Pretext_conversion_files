        Energy is the ability to do work,
        to move something against a force opposing the motion.
        The movement of air, water and rock require the input of energy.

        Heat is energy flowing from a place of higher temperature to a place of lower temperature.
        Heat flows through and between Earth's various spheres through four mechanisms:
        radiation, convection, advection and conduction.

        Temperature is a measure of the average energy of the molecules in a system.
        Temperature is measured on several scales:
        conversion between scales is an oft-required skill.

        For interesting reasons, energy,
        heat and temperature are wrapped together in the color of light an object emits.
        Not all objects are hot enough to emit visible light,
        but all objects in the Universe emit light,
        and we can tell the temperature of these objects,
        whether they are across the room or across the Universe.

        Earth's spheres interact to form Earth's climate.
        These interactions are driven by energy,
        most of which is supplied by the Sun.
        Understanding the magnitude,
        mechanisms and implications of this solar energy is the core goal of this book.
