  <title>Global and Zonal Average Temperatures</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Although you may not have realized it when we first defined them,
      <m>T_{eq}</m> and <m>T_{avg}</m> are both global annual average temperatures.
      They have to be:
      they lack any information about time of year or location.
      They provide the least detailed,
      but most broadly useful, measure of Earth's temperature.
      But as our discussion of Parmenides' zonal climate belts suggested,
      we expect that both insolation (S) and albedo (A) most likely vary with latitude.
      If insolation and albedo are functions of latitude,
      then Earth's surface temperature should vary with latitude as well.

    <title>Albedo variation across Earth</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        <xref ref="fig_Apollo17">Figure</xref>
        shows one of the more famous photographs ever taken: Earth viewed from NASA's Apollo 17 spacecraft on its way to the Moon.
        The inset superimposes the climate zones from <xref ref="fig_globe">Figure</xref> on the photograph
        (which is far too stunning to hide under unsightly labels!)
        Particularly on the continents,
        you can easily see how albedo varies with latitude.
        Around <m>\ang{30}</m>N and S, bright reflective deserts dominate the land surface,
        while in the Tropics dark rainforest predominate,
        except where hidden by a broken band of clouds along the equator.
        Farther south, in the Southern Hemisphere Temperate zone,
        a merry-go-round of large,
        comma-shaped high-albedo cloud systems rotate around highly reflective polar areas of Antarctica.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to another NASA mission,
        we have excellent measurements of albedo for the globe.
        The left-hand panel of <xref ref="fig_albedomap">Figure</xref> shows annual average albedos
        (including the effect of clouds),
        while the panel to the right shows zonal averages.
        The zonal pattern of albedo variation glimpsed in <xref ref="fig_Apollo17">Figure</xref> is readily visible.
        Where clouds are absent,
        albedo is controlled by the type of material at Earth's surface.
        Snow and ice have albedos of 0.4 to 0.95, depending on age;
        water from 0.03 to 0.10;
        and grasslands and forests around 0.25.
        High albedos in the poles are<mdash/>or at least have been until recently<mdash/>the norm.
        On the other hand, much of the equatorial region is ocean,
        with relatively low albedos.
        The band of slightly elevated albedo just north of the Equator is due to clouds associated with an important atmospheric region called the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ);
        you can see clouds associated with the ITCZ in the photograph of <xref ref="fig_Apollo17">Figure</xref>.
        Rapid transitions from low
        (dark blue on <xref ref="fig_albedomap">Figure</xref>)
        to moderate albedo
        (aqua on <xref ref="fig_albedomap">Figure</xref>)
        over the oceans at <m>\ang{30}</m>N and S mark the limits of high pressure systems in the atmosphere;
        these systems and the ITCZ will play crucial roles in understanding the movement of heat in the atmosphere.

      <title>The Reasons for Seasons</title>
      <p>
        All else being equal,
        you'd expect that Earth's less reflective Tropics would be warmer than the Poles,
        simply because the former reflect far less heat back to space than the latter.
        Of course, all else here means insolation,
        and insolation is not equal across Earth's surface, or over time.
        Insolation varies by day,
        as Earth spins around its axis each 24 hours, and annually,
        as Earth orbits the Sun each year.
        Earth's motions through space are fundamental to our understanding of Earth's spheres,
        climate and weather.
        This seems like a good as time as any to review them.
        <xref ref="fig_season1">Figure</xref>
        shows the schematic relationship between Earth and two points of reference in the sky:
        our Sun, and the star Polaris.
        Relative to the Sun, Earth completes one rotation around its axis every 24 hours,
        or one day.
        We can imagine Earth's rotation axis as pointing out of the North Pole and into space,
        where it currently points near Polaris, or the North Star.
        Visualizing this rotation is easier using a time lapse photograph of the night sky.
        The spectacular result in <xref ref="fig_startrails">Figure</xref>
        shows trails caused by the apparent motion of stars as Earth rotates beneath the vault of the heavens.
        Look carefully at the bulls-eye of stars above and to the left of the volcano:
        the star with the shortest trail is Polaris,
        low on the horizon from tropical Indonesia,
        where the photograph was taken.
        Even as it rotates around its axis, Earth is orbiting around the Sun.
        The plane of Earth's orbital motion is called the ecliptic plane,
        and is shown by the blue dashed line in <xref ref="fig_season1">Figure</xref>.
        On average, Earth moves about 66,000 mph along its orbit<fn>
        The tropical year is 365.24 days long,
        and Earth's average distance from the sun is roughly 1 AU. Thus,
        skipping units,
        <m>v_{orbit}=\frac{c_{orbit}}{t_{orbit}}=\frac{2\cdot\pi\cdot(150x10^6/1.62)}{365.24\cdot24}\sim 66400</m> mph.
        The JPL Horizons server gives components of Earth's orbital velocity;
        averaging daily values of these for 2019 CE gives  <m>v_{orbit}=\sim\SI{66628.1}{\kilo\metre\per\sec}</m>.
        I note that the approximate value is within 0.3% of the actual value,
        took a few seconds to calculate,
        and doesn't return the velocity of the devil.
        </fn>,
        a little more in the northern hemisphere winter,
        and little less in northern hemisphere summer.
        Summer and winter exists, however,
        only because Earth's rotational axis is tilted relative to the orbital plane.
        This tilt<mdash/>Earth's <em>obliquity</em><mdash/>is currently <m>\ang{23.4}</m>,
        and this angle is what defines the classic limits of Paramendies' climate zones in <xref ref="fig_globe">Figure</xref>.
        Obliquity is also causes Earth's seasons.
        Because Earth's axis is (currently) fixed in the direction of Polaris,
        the relative relationship of Earth and Sun changes during the year,
        as Earth rumbles along its orbit.
        <xref ref="fig_season2">Figure</xref>
        shows Earth's orbit around the sun from far above
        (in the upper panel)
        and from the side
        (in the lower panel).
        Again this is a schematic illustration,
        with Earth's size wildly exaggerated relative to that of the orbit.
        (At the scale of the orbit, Earth's diameter would be
        <m>\frac{1}{8}^{th}</m> the width of a human hair.)
        The arrows on the Earth represent the direction to Polaris.
        The first day of Spring, technically called the Vernal Equinox,
        occurs when the angle from the Sun,
        to Earth, and then to Polaris,
        is exactly \ang{90}. For various fascinating reasons<fn>

        Marking time: The epic quest to invent the perfect calendar.
        John Wiley &amp; Sons.. pg. 16
        </fn>,
        this event occurs on March 20 in our civil calendar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first day of Northern Hemisphere Summer begins when Earth, Sun,
        and Polaris lie in a straight line,
        with Earth and Polaris are on opposite sides of the Sun.
        As it happens, Earth is actually farthest from the Sun at about this time:
        seasons have little to do with distance between Earth and Sun.
        The real cause of seasons is of course heat flow!
        Look back to Figure ??? Imagine two
        <q>tubes</q>
        of sunlight,
        each carrying the exact same energy from Sun to Earth.
        One tube happens to hit Earth near the Tropic of Cancer (the one coming directly from the sun image);
        the other hits near the Antarctic Circle.
        At this season, Earth's surface near the Tropics is more or less perpendicular to the Sun's rays:
        the energy in the tube is thus concentrated over a small area
        (the heavy blue line at the end of the tube),
        and so temperatures will be higher.
        Near the Antarctic Circle an equivalent energy
        <q>tube</q>
        hits nearly parallel to Earth's surface.
        The energy is spread over a much wider area,
        and so the area is colder.
        Northern hemisphere autumn begins when the Sun-Earth-Polaris angle is <m>\ang{-90}</m>,
        and finally winter rolls in when the Earth, Sun and Polaris are again in a straight line,
        but with the Earth and Polaris on the same side of the Sun.
        Here the arrangement of relative heating we saw in northern hemisphere summer is reversed,
        with energy spread over smaller areas in the southern hemisphere and larger areas in the northern hemisphere.
        Seasons on Earth are simply due to the way obliquity changes the location of maximum solar heating of Earth's surface.

    <title>Variation of Insolation with Latitude</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        As <xref ref="fig_insolat">Figure</xref> shows,
        the amount of sunlight hitting the top of Earth's atmosphere varies more strongly with latitude than albedo does,
        but in the same sense.
        The solid line gives the annual average,
        with the other lines showing daily totals for the first day of summer
        (summer solstice)
        and winter
        (winter solstice)
        in the northern hemisphere.
        Two features of the graph are particularly interesting.
        One is the impressive symmetry of the annual average around the equator.
        We expect from our understanding of the seasons that the average insolation should be about the same for each hemisphere.
        The second feature is that<mdash/>to little surprise<mdash/>the Tropics receive more insolation than the Poles.
        More energy mean, most likely, higher temperatures.
        Measured at the top of the atmosphere,
        far above the clouds and Earth's surface,
        the Tropics receive over twice the solar energy as the Poles.
        Combined with the Tropics lower albedo,
        the reasons for the Tropics warmth relative to the Poles is becoming increasingly clear.
        Another interesting feature is the minima in monthly insolation near the Arctic and Antarctic Circles.
        These minima are due to the continuous summer daylight near the summer pole,
        which adds to the annual totals for areas poleward of the Arctic and Antarctic circles
        (an effect clearly visible in <xref ref="fig_Apollo17">Figure</xref>,
        where you can see thta all of Antarctica,
        on both sides of the South Pole, is bathed in sunlight).
        Continuous winter darkness in the same zones explains the areas of 0 winter-time insolation as well.
        The gray shading on the left-hand side of Earth represents the night-time hemisphere.
        Note that Antarctica remains in darkness,
        while all of the areas above the Arctic Circle are bathed in continuous sunlight.
      </p>
      <p>
        We saw on <xref ref="distance_cite">page</xref>
        that Earth's seasons are caused by Earth's obliquity,
        and you read that the seasons have
        <q>little</q>
        to do with Earth's distance from the Sun.
        Little, but not nothing.
        Earth is closest to the sun
        (the technical term is
        <q>at perihelion</q>
        )
        on January 4 or so,
        just after the southern hemisphere's summer solstice.
        Earth is farthest from the sun (
        <q>at aphelion</q>
        ) on July 4 or so, just after northern hemisphere's summer solstice.
        The distance difference is only 3.4%, but because energy decreases as the square of distance from the sun,
        the northern hemisphere receives about 6.8% <em>less</em>
        insolation during its summer than the southern hemisphere does,
        despite the fact that northern hemisphere summer is 4.5 days longer.
        The net result of this is that the Northern Hemisphere gets a little less insolation than the Southern Hemisphere,
        as you can see on <xref ref="fig_insolat">Figure</xref>.
        Changes in these subtle relationships between seasons and proximity to the Sun are the primary drivers of Ice Ages,
        a subject we'll examine in chapter 13.

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Earth's Predicted <em>versus</em> Actual Zonal Temperatures: Where's the Heat Going?</title>
      <p>
        So we now have a good understanding of how both insolation and albedo vary with latitude over Earth.
        Using a variant of <xref ref="eq_ts">Equation</xref>,
        we can find the expected zonal average temperatures,
        that is the temperature at each latitude of Earth,
        based on the insolation received at each latitude,
        and the average albedo at each latitude:
        <md>
          <mrow>T_{lat,\ expected}\amp =T_{eq,\ zonal}+\Delta T_{GHE}</mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="eq_Tlat1" number="yes">T_{lat,\ expected}\amp =\left[\frac{S_{lat}*\left(1-A_{lat}\right)}{4 \sigma}\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}+ 33\ K</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        This equation isn't all that different than the form we've already used,
        except here we're using multiple values for insolation (S) and albedo (A), each keyed to a different latitude,
        as indicated by the
        <q>lat</q>
        subscripts.
        <xref ref="fig_avgsurftemp">Figure</xref>
        shows the resulting pattern of expected
        (as calculated from <xref ref="eq_Tlat1">Equations</xref>)
        and the actual annual average temperatures measured over Earth's latitudes.
        The two horizontal dotted lines are old friends:
        <m>T_{eq}</m> and <m>T_{av}</m>.
        These are both global annual average temperatures.
        They have to be:
        they lack any information about time of year or location.
        Both characteristic temperatures are horizontal lines because,
        by definition,
        they are independent of latitude.
        Note that <m>T_{av}</m> is \SI{33}{\kelvin} greater than <m>T_{eq}</m> because of the GHE.
      </p>
      <p>
        The zonal average temperatures <em>calculated</em>
        using <xref ref="eq_Tlat1">Equation</xref>
        are shown by the blue dot-dash line,
        while the <em>measured</em><fn>
        Actually this the cos(2*lat) model of measured surface temperatures of North, G. R., &amp; Coakley Jr, J. A. (1979).
        Differences between seasonal and mean annual energy balance model calculations of climate and climate sensitivity.
        Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 36(7), 1189-1204.
        </fn> zonal average temperatures are shown by the solid green curve.
        Yet again it seems we have done a great deal of work to little end.
        Our calculated temperatures
        (blue dashed-dot)
        are far too cold compared to observed values.
        But if we add in the greenhouse effect, <m>\Delta T_{GHE}</m>,
        we get the model shown by the red dashed line,
        <m>T_{calculated, GHE}</m>,
        which does a great job predicting temperatures across Earth's surface.
        This model, labeled <m>T_{calculated, GHE}</m> in the figure isn't perfect.
        Compared to the actual temperature patterns the model is still too hot in the tropics and too cold in the poles, with a
        <q>cross-over</q>
        at about <m>\ang{39}</m>N and
        <m>\ang{39}</m>S, near the boundary of the Temperate zones with the Tropics.
        Fortunately we are now old hands at heat and temperature.
        The calculated average temperatures don't account for heat <em>flowing</em>
        from the warmer tropics to the cooler poles.
        The heat pulled from the tropics lowers the temperatures there,
        while raising temperature at the poles.
        So all our calculations were helpful:
        they allow us to hypothesize that heat is flowing from the Tropics toward the Poles.
        This thermal imbalance between the Poles and the tropics,
        set up by differences in albedo and insolation,
        is the primary driver of weather,
        and hence climate, on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        This hypothesis is beautifully confirmed by NASA's Earth Radiation and Budget Experiment satellite.
        This mission measured both incoming short-wave radiation (SWR) from the Sun,
        and the long-wave radiation (LWR) emitted from Earth for most of the globe.
        <xref ref="fig_erb">Figure</xref>
        shows that the tropics receive more SWR from the Sun then they emit as LWR. Were such an imbalance to continue,
        the tropics would be steadily warming
        (which they are not).
        The reverse observation happens in both the temperate and polar areas:
        they actually emit more LWR energy than they receive as SWR. Were such an imbalance to continue,
        the polar regions would be cooling
        (which they are not).
        The green, solid line in Figure 22 is the difference in net radiation.
        The
        <q>excess</q>
        energy between <m>\ang{30}</m> N and
        <m>\ang{30}</m>S does what heat naturally does:
        flows to cooler areas, the temperate and polar zones.
        Imagine the
        <q>hill</q>
        of positive net energy in the Tropics oozing out to fill in the
        <q>valleys</q>
        on either side.
        Figure 23 shows the enormous scale of this heat flow.
        Energy flow peaks at \SI{6}{\peta\watt}, the equivalent energy of 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs exploding <em>every second</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This meridional (north-south) movement of heat is the primary driver of weather on Earth's surface.
        Most of this heat moves by advection, some by convection,
        primarily through motions of the atmosphere,
        a little by motions of the oceans.
        We will have much more to say about this energy flow,
        eventually using it to explain such disparate facts as the European
        <q>discovery</q>
        of the Americas,
        why Canada is the largest supplier of lumber to the United States<fn>
        All timber products,
        as reported by the Foreign Agricultural Service http://apps.fas.usda.gov/gats/default.aspxm accessed February 04, 2016.
        </fn>,
        and why 21 Bostonians died in the early afternoon of January 15, 1919,
        drowned in a flood of molasses<fn>

        <em>Without Warning, Molasses in January Surged Over Boston</em>.
        Smithsonian 14 (8): 213-230
        </fn>.
        But before we do that,
        we need to understand each of Earth's natural spheres,
        how they formed, how the move,
        and how they have evolved over the long 4.567 billion years of Earth's history.
