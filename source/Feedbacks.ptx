  <title>Introduction: the importance of Cryosphere<mdash/>climate feed backs</title>
  <p>
    Uniquely among, well,
    the entire known Universe, Earth's average surface temperature (\SI{288}{\kelvin}, \SI{15}{\celsius},
    <m>60^{\circ}F</m>) and pressure are near the freezing point of water (\SI{273}{\kelvin}, \SI{0}{\celsius}, <m>32^{\circ}F</m>).
    At various times, in various places and for various durations,
    temperatures fall below that freezing point and in a complex and still incompletely understood process<fn>

    </fn> liquid water freezes into solid ice.
    The sum total of all that ice at any time is Earth's <em>Cryosphere</em>.
    If you look back at the previous few chapters, you'll find a theme:
    our examination of each sphere starts with a monologue about the sphere's role in moving heat from the Equator to the Poles,
    moderating Earth's surface temperatures.
    Not this chapter.
    The Cryosphere is too small, too un-massive,
    too static and too ephemeral to move any substantial heat around the planet.
    On local and regional scales,
    the Cryosphere acts like a thermal battery, storing heat for later,
    slower release,
    and moderating local and regional temperature changes.
    But the climatically important role of the Cryosphere lies at the core of its ephemerality:
    newly-fallen snow and ice are bright and reflective,
    so they have unusual high albedo.
    Snow and ice can reduce Earth's equilibrium surface temperature,
    and hence make the additional snow and ice more likely.
    These feedbacks reach into the heart of the carbon cycle,
    so the cryosphere-albedo-surface temperature feedback is one of the strongest and most important in climatology.
    For the past 2.6 million years these feedbacks have repeatedly plunged Earth into Ice Ages<fn>

    and even affected the timing and path of human evolution and migration.

    The feedback begins with increases in snow and ice <xref ref="fig_cryo_albedo_feedback">cover</xref>,
    which reduces Earth's average albedo.
    It doesn't take much snow to raise Earth's albedo significantly:
    coating just 1% of Earth's surface with snow
    (about the amount shown in <xref ref="fig_jonas">Figure</xref>)
    would raise average albedo by nearly 2 percentage points<fn>
    Roughly, for an Earth (<m>A_\Earth=0.30</m>) fraction <m>f</m> newly covered with snow (<m>A_{snow}=0.80</m>),
    <m>A_{new} \approx (1-f)A_\Earth+fA_{snow}</m> so
    <m>A_{new} \approx 0.305</m> and <m>dA=0.005=5/3\%</m>.
    </fn>.
    This albedo change leads to a change in Earth's equilibrium temperature <m>T_{eq}</m><mdash/>assuming the snow never melted or darkened,
    reasonable in this thought experiment<mdash/> of \SI{0.5}K (see<fn>
    For <m>T_{eq}=\left(\frac{S(1-A)}{4\sigma}\right)^{1/4}</m>,
    <m>\left(dT_{eq}\right)_S=-\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{1-A}T_{eq}dA=\SI{0.46}{\kelvin}</m>
    </fn>), which lowers the surface temperature,
    <m>T_{surf}</m>,
    which increases the Cryosphere's stability formation of more snow and ice.
    Over time, average temperatures in the oceans fall,
    which draws <m>CO_2</m> from the atmosphere and into the oceans,
    reducing the greenhouse effect,
    further lowering <m>T_{surf}</m> and altering the carbon cycle!
    A little bit of snow can,
    over a few centuries, make a difference of the world.
    The intricate relationships between the Cryosphere and other aspects of the Earth System are shown in <xref ref="fig_cryo_concept_map">Figure</xref>.
    We'll explore the Cryosphere in reverse,
    briefly noting the small and temporary components,
    and then dwelling on glaciers and ice sheets.
    These will lead us naturally into our examination of the Ice Ages and the factors<mdash/>both here on Earth and in the greater Solar System<mdash/>controlling them.
