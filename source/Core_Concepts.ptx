        Our Solar System formed 4.567 billion years ago from a large nebula of gas,
        dust and ice.

        Earth grew through the accretion of billions of differentiated objects,
        formed from the dust and ice in the nebula.
        Meteorites contain abundant evidence for the timing and rate of this accretion.
        Earth largely completed its formation 100 Million years after formation began.

        As a result of the way it accreted,
        the solid Earth is layered chemically,
        mechanically and thermally.
        The chemical layers include the metallic core,
        the rocky mantle, and two different kinds of crust.
        Mechanically, Earth includes a solid inner core,
        a liquid outer core, a convecting mantle, the weak,
        partially molten asthenosphere and the solid,
        strong, stiff and cold lithosphere.

        Earth's lithosphere is naturally divided into plates,
        which move across the asthenosphere at a few centimeters per year.
        The plates are thin but strong,
        and deform only at their edges,
        where earthquakes, volcanoes and mountain belts form.
        The movement and interactions of the plate are described by Plate Tectonic Theory

        Science has a hierarchy of understanding and surety,
        which includes theories, hypotheses, facts and laws.
        The scientific definitions of these concepts are different than the common-use definitions.
