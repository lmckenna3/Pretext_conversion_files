  <title>Choosing not to choose is choosing</title>
  <p>
    This chapter is one long ethical and scientific argument about what,
    if any, responsibilities we have for the welfare of other people,
    even those we may never meet or even those born after we die.
    Such questions are unusual in any textbook,
    particularly one on science.
    But the ethical dilemmas posed by the global collective action problem of climate change are unique.
    Climate change happens so slowly,
    and the causes are so diffuse,
    that the affective moral outrage we normally associate with ethical transgressions are simply missing in our species<fn>

    If you look back over this chapter you'll see that our examination of ethics,
    morals and collective actions has all been very data-driven:
    we've examined morals and ethics
    <em>scientifically</em>.
    Values-the morals buried deep in our affective brains-matter in any discussion of climate change and how these changes will affect us.
    This is particularly true because it focuses our attention on where disagreements belong:
    on how we choose to react to climate change,
    not to the actuality of the change or its largely human-induced causes.

    So now the choice is yours.
    You have to choose what moral obligations you have to your group
    (whatever that group is),
    and how you can help them flourish by contributing to planetary stewardship.
    Neither I, your professor,
    nor your classmates can tell you what choices to make in this regard.
    Whether you explicitly choose to act a certain way,
    or choose not to make a choice at all and just
    <q>muddle through,</q>
    your individual actions matter.
    To you, to your group, and ultimately our species.
