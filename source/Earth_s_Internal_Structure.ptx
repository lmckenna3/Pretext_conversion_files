    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      Earth's ferocious formation has left its mark on our planet.
      We concluded in the previous section that Earth is layered,
      with denser metals in the core,
      less dense rock in the mantle and crust,
      and quite light water and gasses in the atmosphere and hydrosphere.
      Even 4.567 billion years later, Earth's structure reflects the way,
      and the what, of which it formed.
      Of course those 4.567 billion years have seen significant cooling and chemical changes in all parts of Earth,
      changes we will examine in this and subsequent chapters.
      The remainder of this chapter is devoted to understanding the surprisingly dynamic rocky part of our planet,
      the Geosphere.
      To fully understand and appreciate Earth's behavior,
      you have to realize that Earth's interior is at enormous pressures and high temperatures,
      and that at these extreme conditions rocks will flow like honey,
      metal will flow like water,
      and water is a chemically vicious substance more like gas than liquid.

    <title>Density and Bulk Composition</title>
    <p>
      The simplest and most important question we can about Earth is
      <q>What is it made of?</q>
      Although Earth accreted from a variety of different types of differentiated meteorites,
      a good estimate for Earth's composition is provided by a particular type of primitive meteorites called
      <em>enstatite chondrites</em>.
      These meteorites give the best match of both the chemical and isotopic composition of the planet.
      Despite its size and magnificent complexity, Table 3 shows that 99.5% of Earth is made up of just 7 elements!
      To first order, Earth will behave like a ball of these elements.
      This is a profound constraint of Earth's behavior:
      it will not act like an all water planet, nor a planet of gold.
      Earth behaves like a planet made of rock (a mixture of Si, O and other elements) with a metallic (Fe and Ni and other elements) core.

    <p>
      We have already seen that the cores of differentiated planets are mostly metals like Fe and Ni.
      If we make the simple
      (and wrong)
      guess that all the Fe and Ni separated into the core,
      we'd expect the core to make up 28%+2%=30% of Earth.
      The actual mass of the core is about 32% of Earth's total mass,
      so there must be more than just Fe and Ni in the core,
      including sulphur (S) and silicon (Si),
      and perhaps some other light elements like H and O
    </p>
    <p>
      A different and powerful approach to estimating Earth's bulk composition is to use density,
      the ratio of mass to volume of an object.
      Earth has a well determined mass of <m>M=\SI{5.9726e24}{\kilo\gram}</m>.
      The average radius <m>r</m> of the planet is \SI{6.371e6}{\metre}. Earth's density <m>\rho_{Earth}</m> is
      <men>
        \rho_{Earth}=\frac{Mass_{Earth}}{Volume_{Earth}}=\frac{Mass_{Earth}}{\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}=\frac{\SI{5.9726e24}{\kilo\gram}}{\frac{4}{3} \pi (\SI{6.371e6}{\metre})^3}=\SI{5515}{\kilo\gram\per\metre^3}
      </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      Earth has an average density about 5.5 times the density of water,
      or about twice the average density of rocks at the surface.
      This high density is partly due to Earth's tremendous internal pressures,
      which compress rocks and metals in the interior to high densities.
      Even accounting for this, Earth is far too dense to be made only of rock,
      so much of Earth's interior must be made of metal.
      But just how much?
      <xref ref="fig_bulkdensity">Figure</xref>
      shows the expected bulk density for planets of Earth mass,
      but composed of different mixtures of metal to rock . A pure rock planet would be much less dense
      (and hence of larger radius)
      than Earth, while a planet made from mostly iron would be much more dense
      (and hence far smaller).
      Using reasonable models for the behavior of rocks and metals at high pressure, Earth should have about 32% metal,
      in excellent agreement with observation.
      The same process can be used to calculate the size and densities of planets over a wide range of compositions and masses.
      Over the past 20 years astronomers have discovered thousands of planets around distant stars,
      and for a small sub-set of these (roughly 850 planets<fn>
      843 as of 23 June 2019 http://exoplanet.eu/ The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia
      </fn>) herculean efforts have provided both mass and radius of these far-distant worlds.
      The same process we used above is providing the first hints of the composition of Earth-sized planets thousands of light years distant.
      As we saw in Chapter 4, knowing the color of these planets' stars gives us their temperature,
      from which we can infer the surface temperature of the planets.
      Incredibly, we live in the first era in history where we can estimate the
      <q>Earth-likeliness</q>
      of distant worlds<fn>

    <title>How do we know?</title>
    <p>
      Before we dig into the Geosphere,
      a brief interlude on how we know the remarkably precise details of Earth's internal structure,
      composition and temperature.
      Earth's radius is on average 6370 km,
      about the same distance as a drive from Juneau, AK to Jacksonville, Fl.
      The deepest anyone has actually walked in Earth-the deepest mine-is slightly less than \SI{4}{\kilo\metre} below ground,
      while the deepest hole ever drilled is only 12 km deep.
      These are 0.06% and 0.2% of Earth's radius-vanishingly small depths into the Geosphere.
      By happy coincidence,
      these are exactly the same proportion as the thickness of the skin of an apple is to the apple itself<fn>
      Fortunately, Homutova, I., &amp; Blazek, J. [in (2006) Differences in fruit skin thickness between selected apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) cultivars assessed by histological and sensory methods.
      Hort.
      Sci.(Prague), 33(3), 108-113] measured typical skin thicknesses of European apple cultivars to be 33 to 73 um.
      According to the Washington Apple Council [http://bestapples.com/trade-and-export-marketing/grades-sizing/, accessed 17 January 2016]
      <q>Washington crops traditionally peak on sizes 100 and 113</q>
      apples per 48 pound box,
      which translates into diameters of 72.1 to 77.5 mm.
      </fn>.
      Our knowledge of the deep Earth comes from less direct means than in-person observation.

    <p>
      Three important lines of evidence reveal Earth's internal structure.
      The most important is through the use of seismic waves,
      sound waves generated in earthquakes.
      The velocity of the various forms of seismic waves depend upon the composition,
      density and temperature of Earth's innards.
      Over the past 30 years,
      seismologist have used increasingly sophisticated mathematical tools on increasingly many earthquake records to precisely determine Earth's internal structure
      (<xref ref="fig_seismic">Figure</xref>).
      Much like a CAT scan uses thousands of x-rays to build a detailed model of a patient's organs,
      seismic studies are beginning to image detailed structures thousands of kilometers below the surface,
      in a level of detail unimaginable just 30 years ago.
      A second line of evidence comes from experiments done in laboratories that squeeze and heat rocks to the conditions expected in the deep Earth
      (<xref ref="fig_anvil">Figure</xref>).
      These experiments provide direct evidence for the behavior of Earth at the extraordinary temperatures and pressures in the interior.
      Technological advances in recent years have led to a slew of new discoveries on the behavior or rocks and metals at the depth of the core-mantle boundary,
      and of iron well into the outer core.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third line of evidence comes from Earth itself:
      mantle xenoliths
      (from the Greek, <em>xenos</em>- foreign and <em>lith</em>- rock,
      a rock that is foreign to the rock around it)
      and inclusions.
      Some volcanic eruptions begin hundreds of kilometers below the surface,
      and gnaw at the surrounding rocks as they rise.
      Occasionally the eruptions will carry pieces of the mantle to the surface,
      where the observant geologist can grab a piece to study at her leisure.
      One such sample is shown in <xref ref="fig_xenolith">Figure</xref>.
      You may be closer to a similar piece of the mantle than you think:
      all natural diamonds are from the mantle,
      brought to the surface in ancient
      (and explosive)
      volcanic eruptions.
      Some diamonds contain microscopic and scientifically priceless inclusions of rocks and minerals from the deep interior.
      The study of these inclusions is revealing for example both the composition and the relative amount of oxygen in the deep mantle.

      <title>Core</title>
      <p>
        Anyone for calling Earth's Core?
        Anyone with a modern smart phone can directly and personally probe Earth's core,
        even though it lies \SI{4000}{\kilo\metre} below the surface.
        Take out that phone and invoke the compass application
        (<xref ref="fig_compass">Figure</xref>).
        Spin the phone around,
        and notice how the phone uses Earth's magnetic field to calculate the direction of the phone's pointing.
        That magnetic field is generated in the molten and rapidly convecting outer core,
        a part of Earth easily probed but not easily appreciated or understood.
        Even less understood is the solid inner core within. \paragraphs{Composition} Seismic waves beautifully reveal the startling nature of the core.
        As <xref ref="fig_interior">Figure</xref>
        shows, Earth's density nearly doubles as one passes from the mantle to the core at depth of about 2890 km.
        As early as 1952, studies had shown that seismic wave velocities in the core were close too,
        but slightly less than, than those in pure Fe.
        This led Francis Birch, one of the founders of geophysics,
        to famously state that the core was iron with an
        <q>uncertain mixture of all the elements<fn>
        Birch, Francis. (1952).
        Elasticity and constitution of the Earth's interior.
        Journal of Geophysical Research, 57(2).
        </fn>.</q>
        Sixty years of research has added some precision to Birch's statement.
        The core is predominantly
        (<xref ref="tab_corecomp">Table</xref>)
        an amalgam of Fe-Ni metal with 10% lighter elements,
        most likely Si with O or S<fn>

        Nature, 543, 99.
        </fn>.
        Seismic wave velocities also reveal the mechanical state of the core.
        Recall that P-waves can pass through both solids and fluids,
        while S-waves can only propagate through solids.
        S-wave velocities go to 0 km/s at the top of the outer core,
        and stay at 0 km/s until the top of the inner core at a depth of 5150 km.
        This behavior is expected of liquids,
        which can't transmit S-waves.
        This behavior is direct evidence that the outer core is a liquid,
        while the inner core is solid.
