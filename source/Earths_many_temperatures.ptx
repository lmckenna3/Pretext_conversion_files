  <title>Opening problem</title>
  <p>
    What happened?
    At the conclusion of Chapter [[3]], we proudly declared that Earth's equilibrium temperature <m>T_{eq}</m>,
    was \SI{255}{\kelvin}, \SI{-18}{\celsius} or
    <m>{-1}^{\circ}</m> F, and then admitted that this temperature was \SI{33}{\kelvin} or
    <m>{60}^{\circ}</m> F colder than the true average temperature of Earth's surface.
    Why is Earth's surface temperature so much warmer than we expect?
