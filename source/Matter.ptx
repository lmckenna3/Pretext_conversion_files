    <p>
      Wave your hand around.
      Go ahead, back and forth a few times.
      Feel the air flowing around your fingers,
      ruffling the hairs on the back of your hand?
      You can't see the air, but clearly something is there.
      If you need more proof, grab a bike pump,
      and try inflating a tire to a 100 psi
      (pounds per square inch).
      The pump works by forcing air from the atmosphere into the tire through a one-way valve.
      As you put more and more air into the tire,
      you'll find the effort you expend adding the next bit gets increasingly difficult.
      Air is
      <q>stuff,</q>
      it has mass and volume,
      and forcing more air into a small volume takes effort.
      That effort, of working against the air pressure in the tire,
      takes energy.

        Matter is anything in the Universe, like air,
        that takes up volume and consists of atoms or its constituent parts<fn>
        This ignores <em>Dark Matter</em>,
        which makes up roughly 84% of the matter in the Universe.

        Matter has mass<mdash/>the resistance to being accelerated<mdash/>which is a very different concept than weight.
        In Earth's natural spheres, matter is made up of atoms,
        which in turn consist of a nucleus surrounded by a field of electrons.
        You almost certainly recall the model of the atom you saw in high school:
        little electrons whizzing around a nice,
        round nucleus in which lay orange protons and purple neutrons.
        Like all scientific models, this one is an approximation,
        and we will need a better approximation to understand climate.

        <title>Electrons</title>
        <p>
          A better model of the atom begins with the negatively charged <em>electrons</em>,
          which act not so much as particles but as waves,
          vibrating restlessly around the nucleus.
          In <xref ref="fig_matter_struct">Figure</xref>,
          the space all those wavy electrons occupy are shown as semi-transparent gray spheres,
          occupying all the volume around and within the nucleus.
          When isolated from atoms,
          electrons behave more like particles,
          but with no physically measurable size.
          All electrons have a single negative electrical charge,
          and have a mass about 1/1800 that of a proton.
          The electron cloud around a nucleus is more than 20,000 times wider than the nucleus<fn>
          Krane, Kenneth S., Introductory Nuclear Physics, Wiley, 1987.
          </fn>.
          At the scale of <xref ref="fig_matter_struct">Figure</xref>,
          the outer edge of the atom's electron cloud would be \SI{150}{m} (roughly 450 feet) away from the nucleus shown in the figure!
          Take a finger and push it into the palm of your other hand.
          The feeling you get from your nerves,
          that feeling of pressure and tension,
          is due to interactions between the electron clouds of the astronomical number of carbon atoms in your skin.
          Those same clouds determine the chemical reactivity of an atom,
          more so than the much heavier but smaller nucleus.
          The small mass and large electric charge of electrons makes them reactive to light.
          This reactivity plays a central role in every topic of this book.

        <title>Protons, neutrons and the nucleus</title>
        <p>
          The nucleus contains over 99.96% of the mass of an atom,
          but less than a trillionth of the volume.
          The tiny nucleus consists of positively charged <em>protons</em>
          and electrically neutral <em>neutrons</em>.
          Not all combinations of protons and neutrons form stable atoms.
          With the exception of hydrogen,
          stable nuclei have about 30% more neutrons than protons,
          an excess that helps hold the nucleus together.
          The number of protons and electrons in atoms is the same,
          so atoms have no net electrical charge.

        <title>Atoms, elements and isotopes</title>
        <p>
          <q>An atom</q>
          refers to a single, identifiable piece of matter.
          The average person consists for example of approximately <m>2.5x10^{27}</m> atoms,
          most of which are hydrogen, the majority of the rest oxygen and carbon.
          All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons in their nucleus;
          this feature of an atom defines its elemental nature.
          Think of elements, such as hydrogen,
          oxygen and carbon, as classes or
          <q>brands</q>
          of atoms.
          Remove a proton from an atom and you change it into a new element.
          The Periodic Table
          (<xref ref="fig_pt">Figure</xref>)
          lists the natural and artificially-made elements in a form reflecting the organization of electrons around the nucleus.
          One of the remarkable truths of the Universe is that only 92 naturally occurring elements make up the Universe we know.
          Yet, 99% of the Universe is made of just two elements:
          hydrogen and helium (See <xref ref="fig_elem_abund">Figure</xref>).
          We'll find in Chapter 5 that only six elements make up 99% of Earth.
          Know them, and carbon, and you know 99% of Earth.

        All atoms of a given isotope have the same number of protons;
        this number defines both the type of element and the element's atomic number.
        Atoms have the same number of electrons orbiting the nucleus as protons within,
        making atoms electrically neutral.
        Unlike the other sub-atomic particles,
        the number of neutrons can vary between atoms of elements,
        reflecting the neutron's role as a stabilizer in the nucleus.
        These different forms, or flavors,
        of an element are called isotopes (See <xref ref="tab_isotopes">Table</xref>).
        Different isotopes are indicated by giving the total number of protons and neutrons as a superscript before the element symbol,
        and the number of protons as a subscript before the symbol:
        <m>\isotope[13][6]{C}</m> means a C atom
        (all of which have 6 protons)
        and 7 neutrons.
        Oxygen has three stable isotopes,
        carbon two, and aluminum just one.
        Carbon has a third,
        unstable isotope that many people have heard of: the famous
        <q>carbon 14</q>. Atoms of <m>\isotope[14][6]{C}</m> are unstable because they have too many neutrons;
        the atom becomes more stable when one of those neutrons spontaneously decays to a proton
        (which stays in the nucleus)
        and an electron
        (which escapes the nucleus).
        This process is going on now,
        even as you read this sentence, in your own body,
        where 3000 to 4000 of your
        <m>\isotope[14][6]{C}</m> atoms decay every second.
        This conversion of C atoms to a N atom happens at a consistent rate,
        and so can be used to tell the age of relatively recent organic material.
        Different isotopes of the same element also have slightly different masses,
        differences which lead to slightly different behaviors.
        This makes isotopes a powerful tracer,
        or proxy, of Earth processes.

        <title>Molecules</title>
        <p>
          Most of the carbon atoms in your body are found in <em>molecules</em>,
          the next order of matter up from an atom.
          Molecules consist of two or more atoms of one or more elements,
          typically joined by shared electrons.
          The methane molecule portrayed in the left of <xref ref="fig_matter_struct">Figure</xref> consist of one carbon atom
          (in black),
          and four hydrogen atoms
          (in white).
          An unfortunate short-hand used by just about every scientist is to call both elements and molecular gasses made of those elements the same thing.
          So for example two bound atoms of nitrogen (N) form nitrogen gas
          (<m>N_{2}</m>).
          The trick to understanding which level of substance is at issue is the context:
          on Earth, most substances are found in molecules, not as individual atoms.

        <title>States</title>
        <p>
          At the temperatures and pressure of Earth's surface,
          matter naturally exists in three states, or phases:
          <em>solid, liquid and gas</em>. (A fourth state, plasma,
          is important in areas of high temperature,
          such as the Sun, but will not concern us.) Water, for example,
          exists as liquid water,
          solid ice and gaseous water vapor at all times on Earth.
          Changes between the phases are physical, not chemical, changes.
          For example, when water evaporates,
          the bonds between oxygen and hydrogen atoms <em>within</em>
          the molecule are not broken.
          Instead, the relatively weak bonds
          <em>between</em> the molecules are broken,
          allowing the molecules to separate.
          Evaporation, melting and sublimation
          (see <xref ref="fig_phase_changes">Figure</xref>)
          all require addition of energy into the system.
          This isn't the same thing as making the system hotter!
          As we'll see in Chapter 5, most melting of rock to form magma happens while the rock cools.
          Because condensation,
          deposition and freezing release energy into the surrounding environment,
          phase changes can move considerable energy around the earth.
          The classic example is a hurricane.
          Hurricanes are driven by evaporation of warm water from the ocean;
          the water vapor then rises into the atmosphere and condenses as rain,
          releasing the energy 5-10 km above the surface.
          The energy released by just one hurricane is 70 times the total human energy production during the same time!<fn>
