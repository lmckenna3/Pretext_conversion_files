    <caption>The opening photograph illustrates the the central theme of this chapter: Earth's icy Cryosphere (represented by the rapidly melting Gr&#xf8;nfjord Glacier in the background) is rapidly melting because of anthropogenic climate change, fueled by <m>CO_2</m> emissions from burning  fuels (represented by the Barentsburg power plant in Svalbard). Temperature change in the Arctic is two to three times the global average, a pattern called
    <q>Arctic Amplification. Photograph by Thomas Nilsen, The Barents Observer. I DO NOT YET HAVE PERMISSION TO USE THIS IMAGE. Original caption: ``In times of climate changes, the view couldn't be more contradictory; a coalmine with a smoky coal power plant in front of a melting glacier. In recent years, the Arctic, and especially Svalbard, has warmed twice as much as the rest of the planet. Presumably owing to warming, most of the glacier retreat rates on Svalbard have increased several folds in recent decades. That includes the Gronfjord glacier just south of Barentsburg. The coal plant in Barentsburg consumes about 30,000 tons of coal annually.  Photo: Thomas Nilsen</q>

  <figure xml:id="fig_cryo_albedo_feedback">
    <caption>The cryosphere-albedo-temperature feedback (upper portion with dashed outline) is a positive feedback system exerting great leverage on Earth's climate. Through connections with ocean temperature (lower portion) this system also intersects the carbon cycle, which ends up twiddling the greenhouse effect thermostat and further extending the feedbacks leverage on climate. Begin with an increase, for whatever reason, in the area covered by highly reflective snow or sea ice. This increases albedo (note the solid green
    <q>gain</q>
    between the two boxes, indicating they change in the same sense), which <em>decreases</em> (red, dashed gain) absorbed short wave energy from the Sun. In turn this reduces Earth's equilibrium temperature <m>T_{eq}</m>, then the average surface temperture <m>T_{surf}</m>, which increases the stability of snow and ice and so starts the cycle anew. Over time scales of a few hundreds to thousands of years<mdash/>quite short geologically<mdash/>the deep oceans begin to cool as well, allowing more <m>CO_2</m> to dissolve into them. This <m>CO_2</m> comes from the atmosphere, so the greenhouse effect lessens, leading to further reductions in <m>T_{surf}</m> and stabilizing the cryosphere even more. These coupled systems play a crucial role in strengthening and terminating recent Ice Ages, and (in the Proterozoic) initiating
    <q>Snowball Earth</q>
    periods.</caption>

Despite this, most people are less familiar with the Cryosphere than any other major system on Earth. The figure maps out the way a changing Cryosphere (in the center) affects other parts of Earth, including the Anthroposphere (shown in blue <em>italic</em> type). The red arrows indicate positive feedbacks which amplify changes to the Cryosphere.

    <caption>An intense winter storm in late January of 2016 brought the Cryosphere to a third of the people in the United States, and left so much snow it was visible from space. This image from NASA's Aqua satellite was taken mid-day on January 24, 2016. Although snow is visible over much of the image, the snow from that storm fell (inset image) in a band from Arkansas to Massachusetts. The Cryosphere<mdash/>the domain of frozen water<mdash/>is stable only where temperatures are below the freezing point of water. Daily and seasonal variations in temperature mean the Cryosphere is exceptionally volatile, more so than any of the Earth's other spheres, even the Biosphere. Long term changes in Earth's surface temperature<mdash/>both natural and man-made<mdash/>can push the Earth into

  <figure xml:id="fig_wheres_the_cryo">
    <caption>The Cryosphere's components, by volume, roughly equivalent to mass. When examined through this lens, the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets dominate the Cryosphere, storing roughly 98% of all Earth's ice. Glaciers and sea ice, although they cover a wide area of each pole, are so thin they contribute little mass to the system. Permafrost and snow aren't shown on the diagram, as the former is rather difficult to quantify, and the latter is too thin and temporary to matter. The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) has three distinct parts, as shown on the upper inset diagram: East (the largest, darkest blue), West (medium blue), and Peninsula (the smallest, shown by the black line). The continent is surrounded by extensive winter-time sea ice (inset). The Greenland Ice Sheet<mdash/>the last vestige of the extensive ice sheets of the most recent Ice Age<mdash/>is continuing to melt, increasing relative sea levels. Arctic sea ice cover is shown in the inset at roughly its maximum extent, although this has been rapidly decreasing for the past two decades. Melting of this floating ice does <em>not</em> increase sea level. Roughly, each 1% of ice shown in the figure is equivalent to \SI{0.7}{\milli\metre} of sea level rise, roughly the annual amount of the AIS and GIS annually meting into the oceans.

Blue shading shows the ranges over which 90% (light blue area) and 50% (darker blue) of all data lay. The dark blue line shows the median. The red and orange lines show the trend for 2018 and 2012 CE, the all time lowest ice recorded. The inset maps show the distribution of sea ice for an typical year. Lower pane, the annual cycles of both Northern Hemisphere (blue) and Southern Hemisphere (orange) sea ice. Note the larger annual variation in the Southern Hemisphere, and the reversed seasons.

    <caption>Upper pane: Annual monthly minimum sea ice extent in the Arctic (solid blue) and Antarctic (orange dashed line). Extent in the Arctic shows, despite substantial year-to-year variations due to natural variability, a clear and accelerating decline, averaging about 1.4% loss <em>per year</em> since 1979. Sea ice extent in Antarctica is more stable, and while it may be growing slowly (AR5, Chapter 4, page 333ff.) recent wide swings in extent suggest future changes may be imminent. Lower pane: Determining when the Arctic will be ice free at the end of the summer melt season (not all year!) begin by mathematically modeling the recorded losses as a function of time. The natural year-to-year variations in the observed minimium areas lead to uncertainty in the results, expressed by the best estimate (solid red line) and confidence interval (red dashed lnes). The best estimate predicts an ice-free Arctic ocean<mdash/>for the first time in the last 100,000 years<mdash/>by 2040 CE, and a 5% chance by 2032 CE.

    <caption>All three perennial ice reservoirs are melting and contributing to sea level rise. The curves show accumulated contributions to sea level rise since 1990 CE, projections are shown with dotted lines. Mountain glaciers are contributing the most now, roughly \SI{0.8}{\milli\metre} per year, while Greenland and Antarctica contribute a little less. The inset shows the total contribution of all three, which surpasses \SI{54}{\milli\metre} per year by 2020: 2 inches. By 2025 CE or so, melting Cryosphere will be adding more than an inch to sea levels every decade, and that value will increase over time. Shading shows very likely (90%) confidence intervals for the values. Data digitized from AR 5, Ch 4, Figure 4.25. Extrapolations are OLS quadratic fits to the digitized data.</caption>

    <caption>The size of the reservoir matters less than the warming of a reservoir, at least as it applies to sea level rise. Above, the blue bars show the proportion of sea level equivalent in each of the three perennial cryosphere reservoirs; Antarctica has the vast majority of the ice, nearly 90%. Mountain glaciers have only 1% of <em>potential</em> sea level equivalent, but contributes 50% of observed sea level rise through 2020 CE. The reason is straight-forward: mountain glaciers are warming far faster than the more polar ice sheets. This graph was suggested by Meier, M.F., M.B. Dyurgerov, U.K. Rick, S. O'Neel, W.T.

    <caption>The rapidity and scale of ice shelf loss on the Antarctic Peninsula is well-documented in this series of satellite images of the Larsen B ice shelf. The images start on January 31, 2002 CE (upper left) and end just 6 weeks later on March 17. In the first image, lines of blue melt-water pools indicate the floating ice shelf is in distress, as melt water pools into existing cracks in the \SI{220}{\metre} (720 foot) thick ice shelf. This water rapidly funnels through the ice shelf, wedging the cracks open and (second image) leading to the rapid disintegration of the shelf into thousands of ice bergs. By March 17, the ice shelf had retreated by \SIrange{50}{60}{\kilo\metre} in less than 45 days. The final image shows the ice shelf's limits in 1947 (violet), 1961 (indigo) and 1993 (blue), which indicates that the shelf had been relatively stable prior to 1993 CE. The red, orange, yellow and green lines indicate the shelf edge over the collapse. The dotted line shows the outline of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, the smallest state (with the longest name) in the United States. Sea level did not rise when the ice shelf broke up; floating ice displaces a volume of water equal to its melted volume.
