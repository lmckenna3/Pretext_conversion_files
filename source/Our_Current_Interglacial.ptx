  <title>The current interglacial</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Humans have been busy since the end of the last glacial cycle.
      At the end of the most recent
      (it won't be the last)
      glacial interval 12 kya, there were 1-10 million humans on the planet.
      To put this in perspective,
      more people live today in Los Angeles, California than lived on the entire planet 12,000 years ago.
      But as ice retreated, the globe warmed,
      and the atmosphere grew wetter,
      small bands of humans around the world invented agriculture<fn>

      Modern humans<mdash/>accustomed to the seemingly abundant food provided by modern industrial agriculture<mdash/>take it for granted that the invention of agriculture was a natural and beneficial progression of human societies,
      but little evidence suggests this.
      Instead, before agriculture and after,
      human population crept upward,
      doubling every 2000 years or so from 12 to 2 kya<fn>

      and statistical analysis of the radiocarbon record.

      </fn>.
      By the dawn of the common era, 2 kya,
      global population had grown to 200 to 400 million souls,
      or about the population of the U. S. Global population is now approximately 7.6 billion and increasing at 1% per year.
      All of this growth has happened over the current interglacial period,
      a brief respite from the usual glacial conditions which have dominated the Northern Hemisphere for the past 1 My.
      In this section,
      we examine how the climate of this interglacial has affected human culture,
      and perhaps equally important,
      how has human culture affected climate of the interglacial.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there is us, Homo sapiens sapiens,
      and the remarkable way we have powered our global influence through our unique ability to use energy.
      Energy not just to run our bodies, but our societies.
      As of 2013, the average global per capita energy consumption was over 25 times the daily nutritional requirement of 2000 kcal/day;
      for the United States this ratio is closer to 100.
      We are the only species that can accomplish this remarkable trait:
      use more energy than the body can consume to do work upon the environment.
      This work has changed all five spheres of the planet.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Temperatures variations</title>
    <p>
      The end of the most recent glaciation was marked by a rapid rise in average surface temperatures,
      driven by increasing <m>CO_2</m> concentrations and
      (in yet another instance of the ice-albedo feedback)
      decreasing extent of ice in the northern hemisphere.
      Extensive research and collection of proxy records allows us to construct a accurate temperature record for the past 12 ky,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_HTR">Figure</xref> (Panel A).
      Temperatures rose by over \SI{4}{\kelvin} (<m>7\circ F</m>) during two long periods from 15,000 BCE to about 2000 BCE. After this,
      temperatures began a slow but steady fall.
      From 500 CE to the present ( <xref ref="fig_HTR"></xref>, Panel B) the density of proxy records increases,
      allowing us to see shorter and smaller temperature changes,
      reflected in the increased
      <q>bumpiness</q>
      in the record.
      Three features in that graph are important to our story,
      and we'll examine them in detail in following sections and chapters.
      The <em>Medieval Climate Anomaly</em>,
      from roughly 950 CE to roughly 1250 CE, was a period of generally stable climate with warm winters,
      shown with orange highlighting in <xref ref="fig_HTR">Figure</xref>, Panel B. The
      <q>MCA</q>
      was followed by a cool period of highly variable weather and cold winters,
      the Little Ice Age,
      that had profound and generally negative effect on European culture in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third trend is unprecedented increase in temperatures since 1850 CE, a feature famously called the
      <q>hockey stick,</q>
      following its first publication in 1998 CE<fn>

      </fn>.
      The graph, the data behind it,
      and the climatologists who first published it have all been the subject of extra-ordinary and extra-unjust controversy,
      including death threats and congressional inquiries<fn>

      average surface temperatures have increased in an unprecedented way since roughly 1850 CE, due largely to emission of GHG, land use changes and the manufacture of cement by humans.
      The remarkable way we have powered our global influence is through our unique ability to use energy.
      Energy not just to run our bodies, but our societies.
      As of 2014 (the most recent year for which data are available<fn>

    <title>What might have been: natural progression w/o humans</title>
    <p>
      We saw in <xref ref="GIGC_causes">Section</xref>
      that the primary drivers of GIGC<mdash/>insolation changes from orbital oscillations,
      and variations in <m>[CO_2]_{atm}</m><mdash/>are both well constrained for the past 800 kya.
      We also saw that most interglacial periods are pretty short,
      geologically speaking, ranging from 7 to 30 ky,
      with a median of about 14 ky.
      Our interglacial is about 12 ky old,
      and based on the recent past,
      it would seem our interglacial might be almost over.
      How much longer will it last?
      A reasonable
      (even hopeful)
      question is whether the natural GIGC cycle might counteract global warming and usher in a new Ice Age.
      The idea that Earth could be on the precipice of another ice age might seem ridiculous to people raised in an ever-warmer planet,
      but the entire point of this book is to use the past as a guide for understanding the present and future.

      </fn> with a sudden and deep return to colder temperatures in between.
      Over the past 11,000 years, temperatures peaked, and then begin a slow,
      gradual decline until the beginning of the industrial Revolution,
      around 1750 CE.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we saw above,
      high eccentricity and precession forcing northern hemisphere summer at aphelion are both necessary to kick off a glacial cycle.
      Notice on <xref ref="fig_milank_wide">Figure</xref>
      that our contemporary eccentricity (Panel B, blue line) is actually quite low compared to other initiations,
      although precession is exactly right for initiation of a new glacial cycle.

      </fn> or so,
      the result of a little too much insolation and relatively high <m>CO_2</m> concentrations in this interglacial
      (see <xref ref="ag_GHG">Section</xref>).
      The same models suggest that,
      even without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, Earth will spend the next 50 to 100 ky in the current inter-glacial,
      the longest interval in the past 2.75 Ma.
      A new glacial cycle will not save human societies from global warming.

      Their use of resources, and the waste products they produced,
      were no more than other non-human organisms produced.
      But the spread of domesticated plants and animals changed both the nature and magnitude of waste production,
      and the evidence for this comes from the same ice cores we've already used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Land use changes</em> required by agriculture include burning,
      clearing,
      and even submergence of natural plant cover to make land amenable to our needs.
      Raising domesticated plants and animals fundamentally changes the way landscapes retain and cycle nutrients,
      including carbon,
      so we shouldn't be surprised that agriculture's early growth and spread affected the carbon cycle,
      and thus changed the atmospheric concentrations of important greenhouse gasses,
      such as <m>CO_2</m> and methane
      (<m>CH_4</m>).
      <xref ref="fig_ruddiman">Figure</xref> shows
      (in blue and green)
      the typical trajectory of GHG during the 8 previous times Earth moved from inter-glacial to glacial conditions,
      lined up using the cyclical nature of the GIGC. In all cases,
      both <m>CO_2</m> and <m>CH_4</m> steadily increase as ice ages end,
      reaching a peak at the warmest and least-glacial time.
      The most recent cycle
      (in orange and red)
      shows the same pattern,
      as would be expected from the regular drum beat of glaciatial cycles.
      After the peak, GHG concentrations in the previous 8 cycles all slowly decrease,
      nudging Earth into the subsequent glacial cycle.
      But the most recent cycle<mdash/>the one and only to include the development and spread of agriculture<mdash/>is different.
      Notice in <xref ref="fig_ruddiman">Figure</xref>, Panel B that rather than falling,
      <m>CO_2</m> concentrations begin to rise about 6 kya during the present cycle,
      the same time agriculture began spreading across the planet.
      Methane concentrations also rise beginning about 4 kya,
      when rice cultivation began in southeastern China. (Rice paddies emit prodigious amounts of methane,
      due to anaerobic respiration of bacteria in the muds of the flooded paddies).

    <title>Culture and Climate Collide: Climate Change in the Historic Period</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        As we slowly approach the present day,
        we should expect two facets of our study of climate to change.
        One is that paleo-temperatures and other climatological features will have more precision and more accuracy.
        Our proxies will be more numerous<fn>
        For example, Figure 2
        (bottom panel)

        </fn> and so the records will have much better time resolution.
        Both of these attributes are nicely displayed in <xref ref="fig_HTR">Figure</xref>
        Panel A, where data from 500 CE onward is finely resolved on an annual basis,
        and rather subtle temperature changes become apparent.
        The second change is that finally we can <em>do</em>
        something with all this data,
        because in modern times we have cultural records,
        actual written and physical objects which allow us to finally see how human societies reacted in the past to climate change.
        After all, the real goal of this book is to help you decide if and what you want to do about Earth's changing climate.

      <title>Medieval Climate Anomaly</title>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most famous society that dealt with climate change in the past millennium are the Norse
        (the ancestors of Vikings)
        who settled islands (<xref ref="fig_norse_map">Figure</xref> in the North Atlantic Ocean,

        Yes, Greenland,

        Hartmen et al. op cit.
        </fn> successfully farmed,
        hunted and traded in two different colonies for 500 years.
        What drove these settlers to journey in open boats across hundreds of miles of featureless ocean?
        How could Greenland be a place where farming and animal husbandry was possible?
        Drought and warmer winters seems to be the key.

        the most recent period of warmth rivaling the 20th Century's warmest periods,
        and thus provides a natural experiment for how societies react to climate change.
        The Norse are interesting not because of who they were or their ancestry,
        but because they illustrate the vulnerability of a society at the edge of sustainability to both changing climates,
        and unchanging cultural practice<fn>

        Ultimately, the Norse abandoned their settlements in Greenland because climate and the world economy changed faster than their culture could.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Norse were a sea-going people who farmed,
        raised domesticated animals (including cattle, sheep and goats)<fn>
        Dugmore et al. op cit.
        </fn> and traded as a way of life.
        The droughts accompanying the MCA were centered over their Scandinavian homeland (<xref ref="fig_drought">Figure</xref>,
        and may have contributed to their westward expansion.
        In Greenland the Norse lived in small, largely isolated farms,
        where they spent summers growing food for themselves and their animals.
        Growing fodder for their animals was an existential prblem:
        despite the MCA's warmth, Greenlandian winters were long,
        so animals were kept indoors,
        and fed fodder by hand, for 9 months of the year<fn>
        Hartman et al., op cit.
        </fn>.
        Theirs was a precarious existence,
        so they supplemented their crops by hunting and collecting wild food,
        most of land-based animals, such a reindeer, with the occasional seal.
        By 1125 CE the Norse has started a new<mdash/>and lucrative<mdash/>way of making a living<fn>

        trading in walrus ivory.
        Nearly every Norse farm have abundant fragments of walrus skulls.
        No tusks, no bones of any other part of the animals, just the skulls.
        These fragments are testaments to the communal hunts members of both the Eastern and Western settlements would conduct each summer,
        as they rowed and sailed the 800 km or more in open boats from their settlements to the <em>nor\dh rsetur</em>
        or Northern Hunting Ground near Disko Bay, Greenland.
        There they harvested walrus ivory for later shipment to Norway and Europe,
        where it was a luxury good and in demand in an increasingly urban and expanding populace<fn>
        Star et al. op. cit
        </fn>.
        The walrus trade bought in enough money and goods to establish and outfit exquisite churches (Figure ) and may well subsidized the settlements pastoral economies.
        But beginning around 1250 CE, as the MCA drew to a close,
        the diet,
        climate and culture of the Greenland Norse began to change.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know this from another proxy:
        the isotopic composition of C and N from the settler's remains.
        Terrestrial and marine animals eat foods with distinctly different ratios of C and N isotopes.
        Consumers of these animals<mdash/>the Norse,
        in this case<mdash/>retain their food's isotopic composition even after their deaths.
        Near 1250 CE isotopic signals indicate a sudden,
        dramatic and permanent change from primarily land-based to marine-based food for the majority of Greenlanders.
        Seals migrating south in the spring were hunted communally,
        and these marine mammals became a staple for all classes and genders in the population.
        The shift is good evidence of crop failure in an increasingly chilly and stormier climate.
        Those same storms made seal hunting more dangerous, even fatal,
        to the very people who were increasingly needed to work the farms<fn>
        Hartman et al. op cit.
        </fn>.
        But the archaeological record indicates that the small,
        outlying farms that predominated in the settlements were abandoned,
        with their farmers taking up as tenants in large central farms as a way of concentrating the work force.
        But other changes,
        far outside the control of Greenlanders, were afoot.
        Europe was changing, and walrus ivory dropped in value over the 1400s,
        while fish and wool became important trading goods.
        Greenlanders choose to provide neither, so trade dried up,
        depriving them of much needed supplies from Europe at the very time their own environment was providing less and less.
        The smaller Western Settlement was finally abandoned around 1360 CE<fn>
        Young et al., op cit.
        </fn>,
        just before the last regular shipping between Greenland and Europe around 1370 CE. The last known voyage to or from the colony was made around 1420,
        and by 1450 CE, the Eastern Settlement was also abandoned.
        The Norse had lived successfully on the shores of Greenland for 450 years,
        nearly twice as long as the US has been a country.
        They successfully adapted much of their lifestyle to conditions imposed on them by the increasingly cold and harsh climate of the period from 1350-1145 CE, but these changes were too small and too late to prevent their society's collapse.
        They were not the only society to suffer from the climate and cultural changes of the Little Ice Age,
        but they may well have been the first.

          The relative warmth and stability of the MCA led to unparallelled growth of populations across the northern hemisphere.
          Both slowly but profoundly eroded after 1250 CE, until by <nbsp/>1450 CE the Northern Hemisphere had entered a Little Ice Age.
          This 4 century-long period of cold centered on the Northern Hemisphere,
          and was strongest across the temperate and sub-polar land areas of the Northern Hemisphere (Figure AR 5. chapter 5 figure 5.9), from Japan,
          across northern Asia, through Europe and onto most of North America.
          All of the southern continents and much of southern Asia were largely spared the colder climates of the LIA<fn>
          AR 5, Chapter 5, Figure 5.09, panels c, e
          </fn>.
          Average temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere were only \SI{0.5(2)}{\celsius} (0.9 <m>^\circ</m>F) colder than the <m>20^{th}</m> century average,
          which doesn't sound terribly cold!
          But even this moderate change was enough to cause glacier growth throughout Europe, Asia and North America,
          bring snowier and longer winters, freeze rivers,
          and to make farming impossible in many northern areas
          (as we saw in Greenland)
          and higher-elevation areas.
          To see how the LIA really affected societies,
          we should consider changes between the MCA and the LIA, as that was the transition that societies actually experienced.
          Europe and North America both cooled by \SI{1(2)}{\celsius} (2 <m>^\circ</m>F) from the MCA to LIA, which stressed an already shaken continent.
          The LIA to produced profound challenges and changes to societies throughout the hemisphere,
          changes that led to colonization of North and South America by Europeans,
          to global and long-lasting effect.

        </fn>.
        Widespread crop failure led to equally-widespread famine across Europe in 1310 CE. The Black Death<mdash/>a plague caused by bacteria spread by rats<mdash/>raced across Europe between 1347 and 1351 CE, leaving 30 to 50% of the population dead.
        So much of Europe was already suffering when temperatures dropped during the LIA. But the cold,
        long winters nucleated a raft of cultural, political,
        social and even artistic movements in Europe that,

          is interesting to us,
          as it shows how newly strong winters were experienced
          (through the eyes of artists working for a greedy ruler)
          by peasants.
          The realistic image features snow above all else,
          snow which covers the entire scene under leaden skies.
          Although the farm seems to be a wealthy one
          (note the pen full of sheep).
          The three peasants
          (two figures to the left;
          the women in pink skirts on the right)
          lack the clothes and shoes needed to keep them warm

          In the right background,
          a better-dressed man languidly chops wood for a fire, while another peasant

          trudges through the heavy snow with a mule's load of wood.
          All of the people depicted are singularly under-prepared for cold weather the artists clearly thought typical of the new European climate.

        The best-known example of art inspired by the Little Ice age are winter landscapes,
        a genre of painting apparently invented
        (at least in Europe)
        by Pieter Brueghel following the powerfully cold winter of 1564-1565 CE. Brueghel's
        <em>Hunters in the Snow</em>
        powerfully evokes the hardships and joys of wintertime in the LIA. Clearly Brueghel isn't painting a real scene
        (he lived in what is now Northern Belgium,
        which conspicuously lacks the mountains depicted in the painting).
        But the painting is rich in carefully rendered details of winter living in the LIA. In the left foreground,
        a trio of clearly tired,
        cold and dejected hunters stump home, carrying only
        (slung on the back of the central figure)
        a pitifully small fox or rabbit,
        hardly enough to feed the pack of hungry dogs behind them.

        are singeing the hairs from hogs prior to preparing a meal<fn>

        </fn> Despite the obvious cold and the threat it presents to the villagers,
        not all of life at this time was toil.
        In the background of the painting, Brueghel carefully depicts villagers enjoying the cold weather,
        by skating, playing hockey, curling and even ice fishing.
        But overall,
        the turmoil created by the LIA was the greatest Europe had seen in a millennium,
        inducing centuries of war, famine and migrations.

          Particularly noteworthy is the dramatic increase in the number,
          longevity and lethality of war during this period.
          The <em>Thirty Year's War</em>,
          fought across central Europe by powers of northern Europe against those in central Europe,
          resulted in the death of 8 million people,

          Zhang, op cit.

          the discoverer of Kepler's Laws,
          which are so crucial to understanding the Ice Ages.
          He was forced to move multiple times across central Europe to avoid the various armies waging the Thirty Years' War.
          He died in 1630 CE, but his grave was desecrated and destroyed by members of the Swedish army.
          Kepler's final resting place is unknown.).
          Migration, both across the European continent and for the first time across ocean basins also peaked at his time.

        That's a pretty bold statement:
        <em>caused</em> implies that climate change itself set in to motion social disturbance, war,
        famine and migration and eventually significant population collapse throughout Europe.
        And if climate change has done this in the past,
        it seems reasonable to ask if current climate change might produce similar turmoil.
        Fortunately, the GCSS has been well studied,
        and the assertion of causality is well documented<fn>

        is one of our typical systems diagrams,
        but this one focuses on human culture.
        Climate change,
        in this case far colder weather in the northern hemisphere,
        starts the chain of causality.
        In response to the shorter growing season and reduction in arable land,
        plant growth goes down, which reduces agricultural production.
        The vast majority of the population of Europe subsisted on grains grown on farms,
        so as grain production fell,
        costs went up,
        and on average the amount of food per person plummeted.
        These economic troubles degraded human health (yellow-filled boxes) including increased famine,
        nutritional stress (adult heights dropped by an average of <nbsp/>\SI{2}{\centi\metre} (<m>3/4</m> inch) during the <m>16^{th}</m> century) and epidemics.
        All this personal stress contributed to the growth of societal stress as well (gray-filled boxes),
        including increased frequency of war,
        migrations and other social disturbances.
        All of these factors decimated Europe's population,
        reducing the population by 15%<mdash/>20 million souls<mdash/>effectively delaying population growth in Europe by 50 years<mdash/>two generations.
        The only question is why?
        What caused the LIA?

      <title>Causes (notice the plural) of the MCA and the LIA</title>
      <p>
        Slow, long-term changes in insolation clearly drive the initiation of Ice Ages.
        But such changes can't be responsible for the relatively brief,
        local and oscillatory changes in climate observed during the MCA and LIA. Instead,
        other ephemeral forces may be driving brief changes in Earth's energy balance.
        Or, perhaps the MCA and LIA were just the result of unusual
        (but perfectly normal)
        climatic variations possible in the complex climate system.
        The first hypothesis is testable using proxies,
        the second by understanding models of Earth's climate.
        In this section,
        we'll examine how proxies are constructed and used to constrain Earth's past climate. \paragraphs{Insolation} Could natural natural variations in the sun's output over decades to centuries contribute to the climatological variations of the MCA and LIA? <xref ref="fig_ssn_all">Figure</xref>
        shows two data sets illustrating the relatively small variations in the Sun's output.
        The total solar insolation
        (or TSI)
        is the energy output of the sun at all wavelengths,
        and is shown on <xref ref="fig_ssn_all">Figure</xref>
        (Panel A) for the period over which Earth-orbiting satellites have directly measured the output.
        The original data
        (in blue and orange)
        are
        <q>noisy,</q>
        they vary rapidly over many time scales.
        So the black line shows the
        <q>smoothed</q>
        values, by averaging the data over a 4 month time period.
        Both the noise and the averaging are typically done with data,
        to extract a real signal from the data. (The same process is used to determine you semester grade in classes.
        By averaging over a few exams and homeworks,
        you awarded a grade for your average accomplishments,
        not that second exam when you had the flu!
        The inset graph shows exactly the same data, but shown at true scale,
        with \SI{0}{\watt\per\metre\squared} as the lower limit on the ordinate.
        Clearly the sun's output varies,
        but only by roughly \SI{\pm 0.5}{\watt\per\metre\squared} over the 45 years of measurement,
        a whopping

      <p>
        This is equivalent to varying the length of a typical 45 minute-long class by 1 second:
        to tiny for anyone to notice.
        Regardless of the magnitude,
        the Sun's output clearly varies over a roughly 11-year cycle,
        with peaks in 1980, 1991, 2002 and 2014 CE. This well-known pattern is most-likely due<fn>

        driven by changes deep in the interior of the Sun and largely irrelevant to our story.
        Combined with their small size,
        these rapid variations in the Sun's output couldn't have contributed to the centuries-long MCA or LIA.
      </p>
      <p>
        What about variations in the Sun's output prior to the satellite era,
        and over longer periods?
        Fortunately,
        changes in the Sun's magnetic field also change the number of <em>sunspots</em>
        on the Sun's visible surface.
        <xref ref="fig_sunspots">Figure</xref>
        Panel A is a visible-light image of the sun,
        taken from the SOHO satellite on January 23, 2014.
        The large brown objects marring the surface are sunspots,
        regions of relatively lower temperature
        (and hence lower energy output)
        on the photosphere of the Sun,
        shown enlarged in Panels B and C. Panel D shows a spectacular view of the Sun's limb,
        with arcing plasma tracing the magnetic fields stretching between the sunspot groups.
        Given that total solar insolation <em>and</em>
        the number of sunspots on the Sun's surface (SSN)are driven by the same process,
        it seems reasonable to hypothesis that insolation and sunspot number should be correlated.
        Take a minute to hypothesis about the relationship: Do you expect maxima in sunspot number to correlate with maxima or minima in insolatiuon?
        Why?
        <xref ref="fig_ssn_all">Figure</xref>
        shows that the number of sunspots not only varies over time,
        but does so in good synchronicity with the total solar insolation, but
        (perhaps to your surprise)
        insolation is <em>highest</em> at times of high sunspot number.
        These solar maxima are marked by abundant sunspots,
        but also by even more abundant <em>faculae</em>,
        the bright areas surrounding sunspots.
        These brighter
        (and hence hotter)
        areas release enough energy to counter the dark sunspots.
        <xref ref="fig_ssn_all">Figure</xref>, Panel C shows that the number of sunspots and the Sun's total insolation are reasonably well correlated: Sunspots are a proxy for total solar insolation.

        <em>do not</em> look at the Sun with the naked eye,
        except at sunset and sunrise,
        or you will suffer permanent blindness).
        For the past 400 years we have a good and nearly continuous record of telescopic observations and counts of sunspots.
        The data are rich in detail and pattern,
        as shown on <xref ref="fig_ssn_all2">Figure</xref>, Panel A. The horizontal lines in green show the likely total solar insolation,
        based on the relationship we derived in <xref ref="fig_ssn_all">Figure</xref>.
        The 11-year solar cycle is apparent,
        but so too are <em>Grand Minima</em>,
        periods of little or no sunspots.
        These are nicely revealed by the smoothed count
        (shown in black)
        in the Figure.
        The <em>Maunder Minimum</em> is particularly interesting as it occurred in the middle of the LIA, suggesting that low insolation may have contributed to colder temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alas, our sunspot record only goes back to the middle of the LIA; we have no sunspot information before 1600 CE. Fortunately we have another insolation proxy.
        The sun constantly emits a stream of charged particles,
        delightfully named the solar wind, into space.
        These particles induce aurorae in our atmosphere,
        and inflate a bubble of plasma around the solar system,
        extending to at least twice the orbital radius of Pluto
        (<xref ref="fig_heliosphere">Figure</xref>).
        The size of the heliosphere depends upon the strength of the solar wind,
        which in turn depends directly upon the Sun's total insolation,
        and so varies in the same way as the TSI. Think of the heliosphere as our solar system's part of space, a little
        <q>island</q>
        in the vast realm of inter-stellar space.
        Cosmic rays
        (mostly fast-moving protons and He nuclei)
        are constantly traversing this inter-stellar space,
        and the edge of the heliosphere<mdash/>the heliopause<mdash/>deflects most of these charged particles away from the solar system,
        reducing the amount of radiation hitting Earth.
        Earth's magnetic field also deflects cosmic rays,
        so the flux of radiation hitting Earth's atmosphere is modulated by changes in both the sun and Earth.
        The power of cosmic rays is impressive:
        the most energetic particle yet measured, the "Oh my God" particle,
        blasted into the atmosphere above Utah traveling 99.9999999995% the speed of light,
        and had the same kinetic energy as a baseball traveling 100kph. (The particle has its own Wikipedia page:
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh-My-God_particle).
        Once in the atmosphere,
        cosmic rays collide spectacularly with atmospheric molecules, creating
        <q>showers</q>
        of sub-atomic particles cascading through the sky.
        These particles have enough energy to cause nuclear reactions,
        and one of these reactions produces that most famous of all isotopes,
        carbon 14, or \isotope[14][6]C
        (<xref ref="eq_c14_prod">Equation</xref>).
        Once produced,
        the newly-minted \isotope[14][6]C is oxidized into carbon dioxide (<xref ref="eq_c14_ox">Equation</xref>)and enters the carbon cycle
        (<xref ref="eq_c14_incorp">Equation</xref>).
        Somewhat more than half is incorporated into the biosphere via photosynthesis.
        The remainder enters the oceans on the inorganic part of the C cycle.

      <p>
        Precise dating of \isotope[14][6]C-containing samples
        (counting annual growth rings in trees,
        or annual layers in lake sediments or ice cores, for example)
        permits construction of a record of \isotope[14][6]C production,
        <m>\Delta\isotope[14]{C}</m> through time,
        and is shown in <xref ref="fig_ssn_all2">Figure</xref>
        Panel B. Before you examine the graph,
        work through the physics and hypothesize: Will \isotope[14][6]C rise with total solar irradiation, or fall?
        As the Figure shows,
        <m>\Delta\isotope[14]{C}</m> is inversely correlated with insolation:
        as insolation increases, the heliopause also strengthens,
        so cosmic ray bombardment decreases and with it \isotope[14]C production.
        So we now have a proxy for insolation that is useful for approximately 50,000 years into the past.
        And at first glance the results are consistent with insolation changes contributing to both the LIA and thee MCA: insolation is lower in the LIA and (somewhat) higher than average during the MCA. But the changes are tiny-about \SI{1}{\watt\per\metre\squared}. Perhaps another force was at work?

        <title>Volcanic Eruptions</title>
        <p>
          Large volcanic eruptions inject massive volumes of dust and gas into the atmosphere (<xref ref="fig_pinatubo">Figure</xref>.
          While the dust can change the local weather for a few days,
          and cause wide-spread damage for hundreds of kilometers,
          the dust is relatively heavy and falls out of the atmosphere within minutes to weeks after the eruption<fn>
          Robock, A. (2000).

          Reviews of Geophysics, 38(2), 191-219.

          </fn>.
          But gasses emitted by the volcano can stay in the atmosphere far longer.
          The more commom gasses emitted by volcanoes are our old friends <m>H_2O</m> and <m>CO_2</m>.
          But the amount emitted is vanishingly small compared to the amounts already present in the atmosphere.
          The real climate culprit in eruption is sulfur dioxide,
          or <m>SO_2</m>.
          Particularly large eruptions inject <m>SO_2</m> into the stratosphere,
          where it reacts with water to form small drops of sulphuric acid,
          <m>H_2SO_4</m>.
          These drops are about the same size as the wavelength of visible light,
          and so they are spectacularly efficient at reflecting sunlight back into space.
          Withing two to three weeks,
          these clouds can circle the globe,
          and spread across a hemisphere.
          Even in the stratosphere,
          atmospheric circulation across the equator is weak,
          so eruption tends to increase albedo,
          decrease in-coming energy, and cool only one hemisphere,
          and can do so for 1 to 2 <em>years</em> following an eruption.
          Eruptions are powerful, if brief, drivers of climate.
          The 1815 CE eruption of Tambora,
          on Sulawesi island in Indonesia led to the infamous
          <em>year without a summer</em>
          in 1816 CE, a last swift cold spell in the LIA. Hard frosts every month of summer plagued New England<fn>

          Fortunately,
          the effects of even large eruptions, like Tambora, are brief.
          Within a year or two the droplets suspended in the stratosphere either chemically degrade or fall to the surface.
          Ice cores in particular can preserve this sulfur signal,
          providing a convenient proxy for volcanic reduction of in coming solar energy.

        <title>Solar and volcanic affects on the MCA and LIA</title>

          <xref ref="fig_forcings">Figure</xref>
          shows the result of decades of research quantifying the driving fores of climate during the past millennium.
          The ordinate shows annual <em>differences</em>
          from average forcings for insolation (green),
          volcanic eruption (red) and greenhouse gasses
          (blue).
          Positive differences lead to net warming,
          while negative differences lead to net cooling.
          Clearly our hypothesis that the MCA and LIA were caused by higher and lower insolation is <em>not</em> supported.
          The insolation differences are negative for both periods,
          and the magnitudes are too small to cause the roughly \SIrange{-0.5}{-1}{\kelvin} temperature changes during the LIA. Don't be disappointed
          (or upset)
          that all the work we did on insolation proxies was
          <q>wasted.</q>
          Negative findings, where an hypothesis is disproved,
