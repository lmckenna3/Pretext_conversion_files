    Find Earth's most extreme climate condition,
    and likely you'll find a human habitation near-by
    (<xref ref="fig_humans_thrive">Figure</xref>).
    Humans are a technologically adept species,
    and we have used our tool-making abilities to inhabit every continent,
    every elevation from 100 m below sea level in the Dead Sea Rift to 5000 m above sea level on the Tibetan Plateau,
    and in every climate from the desiccating heat of Death Valley, California to the perennial frigidity of Amundsen-Scott Station, Antarctica.
    Our species' comfort with Earth's diverse and dynamic climate is hardly surprising;
    we evolved here after all.
    But what is climate, and what controls it?
    Why is Earth's surface temperature so different than that of our nearest neighbors in the Solar System, Venus
    (where lead melts to a liquid)
    and Mars (where <m>CO_2</m> freezes as snow)?
