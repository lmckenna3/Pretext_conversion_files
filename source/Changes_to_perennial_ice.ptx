  <title>Changes to perennial ice</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Despite the local and regional effects of melting perennial ice,
      we focus in this book on global-scale issues,
      and that means sea level rise.
      As you can see in <xref ref="tab_wti">Table</xref>,
      the sea level equivalents (SLE) of the perennial Cryosphere ranges from \SI{0.41}{\metre} (16 inches) in mountain glaciers to \SI{58.3}{\metre} (190 feet) for the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
      Between 1990 and 2020 CE, the equivalent of \SI{55}{\milli\metre} (2.1 inches) of sea level rise has melted from the Cryosphere,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_SLR">Figure</xref>.
      The rate of melting is slowly accelerating,
      as you can see from the slightly upward parabolic sweep to the curves in <xref ref="fig_SLR">Figure</xref>,
      reflecting increasing melting over time.
      But it isn't just the volume of water stored in the reservoir that matters,
      at least on human time scales.
      <xref ref="fig_SLR_vs_SLE">Figure</xref> shows
      (in blue)
      the proportion of SLE in each reservoir,
      and in orange the proportion of measured sea level rise due to each reservoir<fn>
      The SLE proportions are from <xref ref="tab_wti">Table</xref>;
      the SLR data are for 2020 CE projections from Figure
      </fn>.
      While mountian glaciers only hold 1% of the SLE, they have contributed 50% of the sea level rise from the entire Cryosphere.
      This seemingly odd result reflects the more significant and rapid heating of mountain glaciers relative to polar ice sheets in the past few decades.
      As of 2014 CE, glaciers are melting enough to add \SI{1.5}{\milli\metre\per\year} (about 0.06 inches) to global sea level.
      By 2020 CE this rate should double,
      and sea level rise from melting ice will reach an inch per decade.
      Seems miniscule, until you realize that this tiny amount adds up,
      year after year, as that new ocean water has no where else to go.
      Other factors contribute to sea level rise (Chapter 6) but melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are unique:
      mass loss in these ice sheets has the potential to raise sea levels suddenly and globally.

      \subsubsection{Melting of the GIS: Arctic Amplification and Albedo Changes} The Greenland Ice Sheet loses mass through both calving and melting,
      but since 2003 CE the rate of melting has increased markedly,
      and now dominates losses there<fn>

      Thanks to innovative research techniques,
      including satellites that precisely measure changes in ice mass and thickness,
      it is clear that most of Greenland is losing mass,
      losses equivalent on average to \SI{2.3}{\metre} (7.5 feet) of the Greenland,
      just since 2003 CE! The combined losses from calving and melting are not uniform:
      <xref ref="fig_GIS_melt">Figure</xref>
      shows the loss is concentrated at the ice sheet's margins,
      particularly near the three large outlet glaciers.
      Only the highest parts of the ice sheet (shown in white in <xref ref="fig_GIS_melt">Figure</xref>
      still has a positive mass balance,
      partly due to orographicly-induced snows on the high part of the sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surface melting is responsible for 70% of the mass loss in Greenland since 2003 CE, and the cause of this melting is two-fold.
      The first effect is heating driven by atmospheric circulation changes,
      ultimately driven by Arctic Amplification and its consequences.
      Changing jet stream behavior tends to drive relatively brief (a month or two), local,
      but intense melting episodes as warm air floods into typically cold areas<fn>

      </fn> Of more regional and longer-lasting concern are albedo changes driving ice melt,
      changes caused by at least three factors<fn>
      Kintisch, ibid.
      </fn>.
      One is naturally occurring dust distributed through the ice;
      as ice melts this dark dust concentrates on the surface,
      decreasing the ice's albedo and increasing melt rates.
      As the Arctic has warmed and regional wind patterns have shifted,
      soot (fine-grained and very dark fluffs of carbon from the incomplete combustion of wood) from forest fires has collected on the ice sheet,
      further reducing the albedo and accelerating melting.
      Finally, in one of the least expected feedback mechanisms you'll find in this book,
      the warming ice of Greenland has become the home to curious communities of bacteria and algae that live in and on the ice sheets themselves<fn>

      </fn>.
      Pigments in the algae stain the ice,
      increasing the albedo and inducing additional melting.
      This additional melting induces more growth of algae,
      and yet another positive feedback loop enters the Cryosphere,
      magnifying change.
      Expect both the area of Greenland Ice Sheet melting,
      and the total amount of melt,
      to increase into the future<fn>

    <title>Antarctic Ice Shelves and Collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Antarctica is ringed by floating ice shelves,
        where outlet glaciers draining the continent reach the ocean.
        The outer portions of the shelves float on the ocean,
        even though they are hundreds of meters thick.
        Despite their thickness,
        the floating shelves are eroded by melting at both their upper and lower surfaces.
        Eventually, cracks propagate through the shelves,
        cleaving off massive tabular ice bergs(<xref ref="fig_B15">Figure</xref>),
        which can drift through the southern ocean for years.
        In recent years, ice shelves in Antarctica,
        and particularly in the northern reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula,
        have rapidly retreated,
        occasionally showing catastrophic and rapid disintegration (<xref ref="fig_LarsenB">Figure</xref>.
        The ice shelves' disintegration does not in itself contribute to sea level rise.
        All floating objects displace their own weight of fluid,
        in this case water in the oceans.
        So when the ice melts, the water essentially occupies the
        <q>hole</q>
        the ice made in the ocean.
        But ice shelves act as
        <q>buttress,</q>
        slowing the flow of outlet glaciers into the ocean.
        Outlet glaciers <em>do</em> contribute to sea level rise when they melt.
        Disappearing ice shelves may allow rapid and catastrophic increases in sea level.
      </p>

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Marine ice sheet instability</title>
      <p>
        <xref ref="fig_buttress">Figure</xref>
        shows an outlet glacier and its fringing ice shelf.
        The shelf melts from both above and below,
        and both of these sources of melting are accelerating because of climate change.
        Air temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula have increased four to six times faster than the global average<fn>
        AR 5, Ch. 4
        </fn>,
        which leads to increased surface melting.
        This melted water runs into cracks in the shelf
        (<xref ref="LarsenB">Figure</xref>, panel A),
        and wedges the ice apart, hastening its disintegration<fn>
        Shepherd, op cit.
        </fn>.
        But climate change is also warming the oceans,
        which melt the ice shelves from below
        (<xref ref="fig_buttress">Figure</xref>).
        The relatively warm and fresh water created by this melting rises along the edge of the shelf,
        contributing to more melting.
        As this process continues the grounding line<mdash/>where the ice shelf and underlying bedrock last touch<mdash/>retreats inland.
        Unfortunately,
        the weight of the grounded ice depresses the bedrock,
        which gets <em>deeper</em> inland,
        allowing the melting and retreating to accelerate.
        As the grounding line moves inland,
        the glacier gets thicker and moves faster,
        accelerating ice loss from the outlet glaciers.
        This process is at least partly responsible for the loss of one fifth of all ice shelves in the Antarctica since 1950 CE<fn>
        Shepherd et al. op cit.
        </fn>.
        Loss of ice shelves has allowed some outlet glaciers in Antarctica to surge forward,
        accelerating loss of Antarctic Ice Sheet and increasing sea levels.
        This marine ice sheet instability (MISI) hypothesis<fn>

        </fn> has profound implications for sea level rise this century.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, most of the photogenic ice shelf losses has been on the Antarctic Peninsula,
        which (fortunately) has a SLE<fn>

        Widespread acceleration of tidewater glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula.

        </fn> of only \SI{0.24}{\metre} (9.5 inches),
        far less than mountain glaciers.
        In West Antarctica, on the other hand,
        about half the ice is susceptible to MISI, and all that ice is buttressed by the three large and dozens of smaller ice shelves,
        the later of which are particularly susceptible to disintegration because of their exposed location.
        These shelves hold back ice with a SLE of \SI{3.4}{\metre} (11 feet),
        enough to flood the homes of 230 million people<mdash/>4% of all people on the planet.
        The IPCC concluded that there is medium confidence that West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass<fn>
        AR 5, Ch. 4, pg. 357
        </fn>,
        but the chances that it will catastrophically disintegrate in the next 200 years is extremely unlikely<mdash/>perhaps 5%. This is a classic example of the ethical and practical difficulties associated with climate change.
        Recall that we define risk as the product of consequence and probability.
        An outcome with zero consequence clearly carries little risk:
        an example might be clicking on the wrong link on a web page.
        In the same way,
        an event with zero probability also has no risk associated with it.
        But WAIS collapse and attendant sea level rise are different.
        The probability is low,
        but the consequences would clearly be catastrophic to the 4% of humans whose lives were destroyed by flooding.
        Oc course the lowest elevation areas are near the ocean,
        which in developed countries are typically occupied by expensive dwellings and residents who want to live at the ocean's edge.
        How would you explain to such a resident the risk of WAIS collapse and the flooding of their home?

      <title>Gravitational bulges and identifying glaciers threatening <em>your</em> hometown</title>
      <p>
        One quirk of ice loss from either Antarctica or Greenland is un-even way that sea levels rise across the globe.
        All that ice in the AIS and GIS has substantial mass,
        and so exerts gravitational force on its surroundings.
        This force is enough to raise local sea levels by as much as a few meters:
        both Antarctica and Greenland are surrounded by bulges of ocean water attracted by their ice sheets.
        If the ice were to melt and the water flow away,
        so too would the ocean bulges.
        Ironically, the disappearance of the bulges just about cancels out the sea level rise from the melting,
        which means that sea level rise is amplified in areas far from the melting ice.
        For example, were the entire WAIS to melt,
        the resulting sea level increase would <em>average</em>
        \SI{3.3}{\metre}, but would be negative close to West Antarctica and more than 25% greater along the US coast,
        which would see \SI{4}{\metre} of sea level increases!
        A remarkable study released in 2017 CE allows users to enter a sea-side city and identify precisely which glaciers present the greatest risk to flooding.
