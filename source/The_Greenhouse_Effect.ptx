  <title>The Greenhouse Effect</title>
  <subsection>
    <title>A brief explanation</title>
    <p>
      Observation 3 from the previous chapter noted that
      <q>anything that slows the radiation of heat from a warm object will keep the object warmer,
      longer.</q>
      Just like a blanket keeps you warmer,
      so too can a planet's atmosphere keep its surface warmer and longer than otherwise.
      This <em>Greenhouse Effect</em>
      is a crucial aspect of Earth's climate, now,
      in Earth's past, and in your future.
      Four naturally occurring greenhouse gasses in Earth's atmosphere<mdash/>water vapor (<m>H_2O</m>),
      carbon dioxide (<m>CO_2</m>),
      methane (<m>CH_4</m>) and nitrous oxide (<m>N_2O</m>)<mdash/>conspire to warm Earth's surface above <m>T_{eq}</m>.
      By absorbing and re-radiating the infrared radiation emitted from Earth's surface,
      these gasses naturally retard the loss of heat from Earth.
      A portion of this re-radiated energy strikes Earth's surface,
      warming it by \SI{33}{\kelvin}. Carbon dioxide,
      although it is neither the primary gas contributing to the Greenhouse Effect,
      nor a major constituent of the atmosphere,
      acts as a thermostat for Earth's climate by regulating the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere.

    <title>Empirical evidence</title>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>An hypothesis: Atmospheres matter to the Greenhouse Effect</title>
      <p>
        At the end of Chapter 3 we successfully calculated an equilibrium surface temperature (<m>T_{eq}</m>) for each of the terrestrial planets,
        but we found rather poor agreement between these temperatures and the actual surface temperatures,
        as recorded in Table 3.04.
        That table is reproduced as <xref ref="tab_atmo_press_ghg">Table</xref>,
        with the addition of an extra parameter:
        the atmospheric pressure on the surface of each planet.
        (Pressure is given in <em>bars</em>,
        which is the surface pressure of Earth's atmosphere at sea level.)
        Neither Mercury nor the Moon have appreciable atmospheres,
        while Mars' thin,
        dry one rates a paltry 1% of Earth's surface pressure.
        The Venusian atmosphere, on the other hand,
        is almost 100 times the pressure of Earth's atmosphere!
        The atmospheric pressure on the surface of Venus is equivalent to that at a depth of \SI{920}{\metre} (3000 ft) in Earth's ocean-some \SI{90}{\metre} (300 ft) greater than the height of the world's tallest building<fn>
        According to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat,
        <url href="http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/">link</url>,
        the Burj Khalifa, Dubai,
        at \SI{828}{\metre} has been the world's tallest building since 2008 CE
        </fn>.
        A careful examination of <xref ref="tab_atmo_press_ghg">Table</xref>
        illustrates an excellent correlation between atmospheric pressure and the difference between the observed average and equilibrium temperatures.
        A saying in science is that correlation between two things doesn't imply that one causes the other.
        But as Edward Tufte noted,
        <q>Correlation is not causation but it sure is a hint</q><fn>

        Beautiful Evidence.
        Cheshire, CT: Graphics, p. 159
        </fn>.
        A good hypothesis is that the amount of atmosphere surrounding a planet not only predicts this temperature difference,
        but causes it as well.

      <title>Testing the hypothesis with a different kind of graph</title>
      <p>
        An excellent way to test this hypothesis is to graph the difference between the observed average surface temperature and the calculated equilibrium temperature (<m>T_{av}- T_{eq}</m>) against atmospheric pressure
        (<m>P</m>).
        Most graphs you've seen in textbooks use arithmetic axes:
        each division on an axis is separated by a constant value.
        The left-hand pane of <xref ref="fig_tghe_P">Figure</xref>
        shows the temperature difference and atmospheric presure on typical arithmetic axes,
        with increments of 20 bar on the horizontal axis and 100 K on the vertical axis.
        The problem with these axes is that data are difficult to see,
        because most of the data points are squeezed into the tiny corner of the graph near the origin.
        This is a common problem in studying Earth:
        the scale of measurement can range over factors of thousands,
        even millions.
        Data like that just don't fit on arithmetic axes.
      </p>
      <p>
        A better way to display such data is to use axes where each division is separated by a constant factor,
        or multiple.
        This factor is typically 10,
        as it is on both axes of the right-hand pane of <xref ref="fig_tghe_P">Figure</xref>.
        Each major division on both axes is a factor of 10 greater than the preceding division.
        This
        <q>log-log</q>
        graph expands the lower left corner of the arithmetic graph,
        allowing us to clearly see the majority of the data.
        The downside of such a graph is that we can't plot any points which are equal to 0, such as atmospheric pressure for Mercury and the Moon.
        The benefits are that a clear pattern emerges,
        one that supports our hypothesis:
        the pressure-temperature difference for Mars, Earth and Venus follows a spectacular line.
        Following Tufte,
        we conclude that the atmosphere of these three planets is somehow warming the surface.

      <title>Natural warming from the Greenhouse Effect</title>
      <p>
        This unexpected behavior by planetary atmospheres is called the
        <em>greenhouse effect</em>,
        a central concept of this text and our study of Earth's Systems.
        The greenhouse effect has profound influence on the climate of Venus, Earth,
        and just about any planet with a dense atmosphere<fn>
        for example, page 35 of Pierrehumbert, R. T, 2011.
        Infrared radiation and planetary temperature, Physics Today, Vol. 64(1),pg 33-38
        </fn>.
        Driven by a remarkable greenhouse effect
        (<xref ref="tab_atmo_press_ghg">Table</xref>)
        the average surface temperature of Venus is an astonishing \SI{737}{\kelvin}, or roughly
        <m>{870}^{\circ}</m> F. This is hotter than the melting point of about a third of the naturally occurring elements,
        including zinc and lead,
        both of which would melt to puddles of liquid on Venus' surface.
        On Earth, the greenhouse effect naturally raises the average surface temperature of the planet from well below the freezing point of water to a comfortable \SI{288}{\kelvin} or \SI{15}{\celsius}
        (<m>{60}^{\circ}</m> F).
        Our planet is habitable
        (for life as we know it, including us!)
        because of this natural greenhouse effect.
        The magnitude of the greenhouse effect is sensitive to even small variations in the concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere,
        which is how tiny inputs of carbon dioxide from the Anthroposphere to the Atmosphere can cause dramatic global climate change.
        We need to understand how trace gasses in the atmosphere cause the greenhouse effect,
        the implications of the greenhouse effect to Earth's climate,
        and how human activities are nudging the greenhouse effect higher.

    <title>Light and molecules</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Light, we decided in Chapter 3, is how electrons interact.
        All matter with a temperature above absolute zero vibrates constantly,
        and vibrating electrons continuously radiate energy as light into their environment.
        This light travels across the Universe until it interacts with electrons which can vibrate with the same energy as the light contains.
        The energy in light is inversely proportional to wavelength and hence color,
        so different electrons absorb different colors of light.
        Some gasses absorb light with energies in the visible portion of the spectrum
        (<xref ref="fig_iodine">Figure</xref>),
        but all gasses absorb and emit some color of light.
        This is the basis for the sometimes arcane science of spectroscopy,
        and for the success of John Tyndall,
        the most important scientist of whom you've never heard.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection xml:id="tyndal">
      <title>Tyndall discovers the ability of carbon dioxide to absorb infrared light</title>
      <p>
        In the 1820s<mdash/>45 years before the American Civil War<mdash/>Joseph Fourier<fn>
        See Spencer Weart's remarkable <em>The Discovery of Global Warming</em> website,
        hosted by the American Institute of Physics, at
        <url href="https://history.aip.org/climate/index.htm">this link</url>,
        last accessed 7 May 2019.
        </fn> had speculated that visible light from the Sun could easily pass through Earth's atmosphere,
        while infrared light from Earth could not.
        Fourier's first hypothesis should come as no surprise to you;
        otherwise you wouldn't be able to see distant buildings,
        mountainsides or even the setting sun.
        But his second hypothesis was far more speculative.
        After all, no one could see infrared light,
        or measure it quantitatively.
        Not until 1859<mdash/>the same year Oregon became the <m>33^{rd}</m> state<mdash/>did John Tyndall experimentally confirm<fn>
        Weart, op cit,
        <url href="http://www.aip.org/history/climate/co2.htm">this page</url>
        </fn> Fourier's second hypothesis.
        In a justly famous set of experiments, Tyndall measured the surprisingly robust ability of both water vapor and carbon dioxide gas to absorb infrared light.
        He also discovered that the two primary constituents of Earth's atmosphere,
        nitrogen (<m>N_2</m>) and oxygen (<m>O_2</m>) gasses,
        do not absorb infrared light to any appreciable degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now know that the ability of water vapor and carbon dioxide to absorb infrared light is due to the shape and composition of these molecules.
        Both molecules have three atoms connected by shared electrons that form bonds.
        Infrared light happens to have exactly the same energy as that which excites the electrons in the bonds,
        causing the molecules to vibrate and oscillate.
        <xref ref="fig_bending_modes">Figure</xref>:
        shows a simple model of how water and carbon dioxide vibrate and rotate.
        These movements are possible only because the molecules have three or more atoms of two or more elements.
        Nitrogen and oxygen gas (<m>N_2</m> and <m>O_2</m> respectively) lack both these properties,
        so cannot absorb infrared radiation to any appreciable magnitude.
        Tyndall knew and explained to the global scientific community these behaviors,
        if not their explanation, over 160 years ago.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Raising the temperature</title>
      <p>
        The energy to vibrate and rotate bonds comes from infrared light hitting the molecules.
        Within a few millionths of a second after the light is absorbed,
        the newly energized molecule bumps into another,
        lower temperature molecule in the atmosphere,
        transferring some of its energy to that molecule<fn>
        Pierrehumbert, R. T, op cit
        </fn>.
        In this manner every gas in the atmosphere<mdash/>even those that can't absorb infrared light<mdash/>gains energy,
        and so gets hotter.
        The greenhouse effect raises the temperature of the entire atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within a second of absorbing the light,
        the warmer greenhouse gas molecule will re-emit some infrared light,
        its vibration or rotation decreasing in response.
        The molecule has no
        <q>memory</q>
        of the direction the original light was traveling,
        so it emits the new infrared light in a random direction,
        effectively sending half of the light toward space,
        and half back down toward the ground.
        The ground absorbs some of that radiation and warms in response,
        which is why Earth's average surface temperature is warmer than the equilibrium temperature.
        The greenhouse effect raises the surface temperature, too.

    <title>Earth's energy balance</title>
    <p>
      If you look back at Figure 3.21,
      you'll see that the sun radiates energy in the ulatra-violet,
      visible and infra-red portions of the spectrum.
      Because ultraviolet and visible light both have shorter wavelengths than infrared light,
      we can lump both together as <em>short wave radiation</em>,
      or <em>SWR</em>.
      The longer-wavelength infrared light is termed
      <em>long wave radiation</em>, or <em>LWR</em>.
      We also learned in Chapter 3 that each square meter of Earth's upper atmosphere facing the Sun receives on average <m>\SI{340}{\watt}</m> of solar power.
      Let's follow the SWR from the Sun as it makes its way from the top of the atmosphere to the Earth's surface
      (<xref ref="fig_erb_a">Figure</xref>),
      in three stages of increasing complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="fig_erb_a">Figure</xref>
      shows <m>\SI{340}{\watt\per\m^{2}}</m> of incoming SWR
      (yellow arrow in the center)
      hitting Earth.
      About 30% of this light is reflected as SWR
      (yellow arrows on left),
      most by clouds and gasses in the atmosphere, some by Earth's surface.
      This reflected portion is due to Earth's
      <em>albedo</em>, <m>A</m>, and amounts to
      <md>
        <mrow>E_{reflected}=Albedo\cdot E_{SWR}</mrow>
        <mrow>E_{reflected}=0.30\cdot \SI{340}{\watt\per\m^{2}}</mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_eref" number="yes">E_{reflected}=\SI{102}{\watt\per\m^{2}}</mrow>
      </md>
      of SWR reflected back into space.
      <q>Reflect</q>
      is a surprisingly precise word.
      Look simultaneously at an object and its reflection in a mirror.
      Note that reflection doesn't change the color,
      and hence energy, of the reflected light.
      True to Fourier's hypothesis and Tyndall's discoveries
      (<xref ref="tyndal">Section</xref>),
      the incoming <em>SWR</em> from the Sun doesn't strongly interact with atmospheric gasses as it travels downward toward the surface.
      After it reflects from the surface, with its energy,
      wavelength and color unchanged,
      the SWR passes unperturbed and unchanged back through the atmosphere and into space. (The tiny portion of the Sun's <em>SWR</em>
      in the ultra-violet spectrum is absorbed about \SI{20}{\kilo\metre} (12 miles) above the surface by ozone,
      a process we'll cover in more detail in Chapter 8.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The 70% of the Sun's SWR <em>not</em>
      reflected back to space must be absorbed by Earth's surface.
      This warms the surface to a temperature you already know,
      <m>T_{eq}</m>, \SI{255}{\kelvin}. But Observation 1 in Chapter 3 says that Earth at equilibrium must emit into space just as much energy it receives from the Sun.
      Hence Earth must emit \SI{238}{\watt\per\m^2} to stay in balance with the incoming solar radiation.
      <md>
        <mrow>E_{absorbed}=E_{SWR}-E_{reflected}</mrow>
        <mrow>E_{absorbed}=\SI{340}{\watt\per\m^{2}}-\SI{102}{\watt\per\m^{2}}</mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_eabs" number="yes">E_{absorbed}=\SI{238}{\watt\per\m^{2}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      But what color is the light emitted by Earth?
      The light emitted by blackbody radiators like Earth is directly related to their equilibrium temperature,
      <m>T_{eq}</m>.
      We can determine the wavelength of Earth's maximum emission using Wein's Law,
      equation 3.05:
      <md>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_lambda_earth" number="yes">\lambda_{max}=\frac{\SI{2.9e6}{\nano\metre\kelvin}}{T}=  \frac{\SI{2.9e6}{\nano\metre\kelvin}}{\SI{255}{\kelvin}} =\SI{1.14e4}{\nano\metre}=\SI{1.14e-5}{\metre}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Look back to Figure 3.16,
      and you can see that this wavelength is deep in the infra-red portion of the spectrum.
      <xref ref="fig_sun_earth_spectrum">Figure</xref>
      shows the Sun's and Earth's spectra on a single diagram.
      Note that Earth
      (in the red tint)
      emits all of its energy as infrared light,
      or LWR! <xref ref="fig_erb_a">Figure</xref> shows this radiation
      (in red as well)
      heading off to space.
      This LWR fought a tough battle to escape Earth's atmosphere.
      We know this because we have thousands of weather stations across Earth's surface,
      and dozens of satellites in Earth's orbit,
      measuring the planet's average temperature.
      This temperature is <m>T_{av}=\SI{288}{\kelvin}</m>,
      far warmer than the <m>T_{eq}</m> we calculated back in Chapter 3.
      <xref ref="fig_erb_b">Figure</xref>
      illustrates the problem: At a temperature of \SI{288}{\kelvin}, Earth's surface radiates <m>E=\sigma (\SI{288}{\kelvin})^4 = \SI{390}{\watt\per\m^2}</m>, far,
      far more than it receives from the Sun.
      What is this source of this energy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Tyndall's discovery explains the origin of this energy.
      The details are shown in Piece 3, <xref ref="fig_erb_c">Figure</xref>.
      As the LWR emitted from the surface travels upward,
      it is absorbed by water vapor,
      carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere.
      As we saw above, these gasses hold on to that energy,
      warming the atmosphere,
      until they re-emit the energy in a random direction.
      Roughly half of this energy will head up to space,
      and roughly half will head down,
      toward the ground, shown in the figure by the large,
      <q>U</q>
      -shaped arrow with magnitude \SI{326}{\watt\per\m^{2}}. Eventually the surface absorbs a good portion of this re-emitted energy,
      and warms in response.
      <em>This is the Greenhouse Effect: Earth's surface is warmed by infrared radiation re-emitted by the atmosphere.</em>

    <title>Three different ways of understanding the Greenhouse Effect</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Understanding the greenhouse effect is central to every topic we examine in this book,
        and so we'll work through three different,
        but complimentary, explanations for it.
        Each is physically correct,
        and each provides insight into the processes behind this crucial concept.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Explaining the Greenhouse Effect through radiation from the atmosphere</title>
      <p>
        You've already read the first explanation in the previous <xref ref="ghe_1">section</xref>:
        the greenhouse effect as radiation from the atmosphere to the surface.
        In this view, Earth's surface is warmer than one expects because <em>both</em>
        the Sun and the atmosphere warm the surface.
        This second,
        unexpected source of energy to the surface leads to a unexpectedly warmer surface temperature.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Explaining the Greenhouse Effect as an atmospheric blanket</title>
      <p>
        Another way to understand the Greenhouse Effect is to consider Observation 3 from the previous chapter:
        <q>Anything that slows the loss of heat from a warm object will keep the object warmer,
        longer.</q>
        Greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere do just this.
        They delay the flow of heat
        (the LWR)
        off the planet just as a blanket delays heat from escaping a body.
        A difference exists between the atmosphere and a blanket in this analogy.
        A blanket is equally good at keeping heat out as in,
        as anyone who has used an oven mitt when picking up a hot pan can attest
        (the mitt slows the flow of heat from the pan to your hand).
        The atmosphere's quality as a blanket is asymmetric,
        allowing incoming SWR through,
        but blocking outgoing LWR, illustrated in <xref ref="fig_sun_earth_spectrum">Figure</xref>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The middle panel shows the relative amount of light emitted by the Sun
        (in yellow)
        and Earth
        (in red)
        as a function of wavelength.
        The higher the curve, the more light
        (and energy)
        is emitted at that wavelength.
        The figure shows that the Sun radiates largely SWR, and Earth LWR. The gray areas in the middle panel depict how effectively Earth's atmosphere transmits radiation at each wavelength:
        the lower the gray area,
        the less absorbing<mdash/>and more transparent<mdash/>is Earth's atmosphere to that wavelength of light.
        The long slow upswing in absorption seen at the blue end of the visible spectrum is due to scattering of light by gas molecules in the atmosphere,
        and largely explains why the sky appears blue and the setting sun red.
        Our atmosphere is of course transparent to visible light,
        but is totally opaque to ultraviolet light with wavelengths less than \SI{300}{\nano\metre}. At the other end of the visible spectrum,
        a series of absorption bands
        (gray in the figure)
        appear at about \SI{750}{\nano\metre}, and become higher and wider to \SI{5000}{\nano\metre}. The upper panel shows these absorption bands are due to water vapor molecules in the atmosphere.
        Carbon dioxide contributes as well,
        including the significant absorption band near \SI{15000}{\nano\metre}. This band is particularly important,
        as it lies on the
        <q>shoulder</q>
        of Earth's emission and absorbs a significant portion of Earth's LWR. All those absorption bands add up to the Greenhouse
        <q>blanket,</q>
        effectively slowing the movement of heat from the surface to space,
        warming the surface <em>via</em> the Greenhouse effect.

      <title>Explaining the Greenhouse Effect as a result of an atmospheric escape threshold</title>
      <p>
        In Chapter 3 we carefully constructed the idea of an equilibrium temperature,
        which we calculated is <m>\SI{255}{\kelvin}</m> for Earth.
        This equilibrium temperature has to be correct:
        the energy Earth receives from the Sun has to be the same energy Earth emits back to space.
        How can this happen if the surface is warmer than <m>\SI{255}{\kelvin}</m>?
        The answer must be that somewhere in the atmosphere Earth has an apparent temperature of 255 K, and that this level of the atmosphere is what
        <q>sees</q>
        space.
        This <em>emission level</em> in the atmosphere will be where infrared light leaving a greenhouse gas molecule has a decent chance of escaping the atmosphere,
        of reaching space before it is absorbed by another greenhouse gas.
        The situation is exactly analogous to walking through a thick forest.
        As you look toward the edge of the forest
        (<xref ref="fig_forest_trees">Figure</xref>, Panel A),
        your sight lines to the meadow beyond are blocked by tree trunks:
        you can't see the edge of the forest for the trees.
        But as you get closer to the forest's edge
        (<xref ref="fig_forest_trees">Figure</xref>, Panel B),
        and fewer trees lay between you and the edge,
        your chances of glimpsing the sky beyond the forest increase.
        Eventually the trees are sufficiently rare that you can see the sky.
        This is the emission level of the forest,
        the distance into the forest that you can see the sky beyond.
        The same idea applies to the atmosphere:
        sufficiently high above Earth's surface, infra-red light can
        <q>see</q>
        space and escape the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <xref ref="fig_emission_heights">Figure</xref>
        shows the variation in emission heights for infra-red light in a mid-latitude winter's atmosphere,
        when the sky is cloudless and blue,
        much like it was when this sentence was written.
        Between \SI{7500}{\nano\metre} and \SI{12500}{\nano\metre} Earth's atmosphere is transparent to most radiation and so emission from a few hundred meters above the surface can make its way to space.
        In essence, the forest here is thin.
        But the large <em>plateau</em> at 15,000 nm again marks the strong absorption peak for <m>CO_2</m>.
        Such is the ability of <m>CO_2</m> to absorb this particular range of infrared radiation that light can't escape to space until it is above 75% of the atmosphere.
        Here the forest is dense.
        The emission level in the atmosphere averages about \SI{5.5}{\kilo\metre} (3 miles),
        although in the figure it lies at about \SI{6.6}{\kilo\metre} km (3.6 miles).
        Above this level infrared light largely escapes the planet;
        below this level we expect infrared light is absorbed and warms the air.
        This warmer air in turns keeps the surface warmer and once again we understand the Greenhouse Effect.

    <title>Earth's Average Surface temperature</title>
    <p>
      We can now write the most important equation in this book,
      one so simple that its importance may seem misplaced:
      <md>
        <mrow>T_s\amp =T_{eq}+\Delta T_{GHE}</mrow>
        <mrow>\SI{288}{\kelvin}\amp =\SI{255}{\kelvin}+\SI{33}{\kelvin}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The equation states that Earth's average surface temperature,
      <m>T_av</m> is equal to the sum of the equilibrium temperature,
      <m>T_{eq}</m>,
      and an increment from the Greenhouse Effect, <m>\Delta T_{GHE}</m>.
      The current magnitude of the natural Greenhouse Effect is <m>\Delta T_{GHE}=\SI{33}{\kelvin}</m>,
      or <m>60^{\circ}</m>F. Earth's equilibrium temperature is about
      <m>0^{\circ}</m>F, the average temperature of Fairbanks, Alaska.
      In February<fn>
      Mean temperature climate normals from the 30-years 1981-2010,
      averaged over Fairbanks AP#2, International Airport, and Midtown stations,

      </fn>.
      Although the feedbacks between life and climate are complex,
      the natural Greenhouse Effect undoubtedly makes the planet habitable for life as we know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw in Chapter 3 that the equilibrium temperature is itself due to the insolation <m>S</m> we receive from the Sun and Earth's albedo <m>A</m>,
      and we saw above that the Greenhouse Effect is a function of the amount and type of greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere:
      <md>
        <mrow>T_s\amp =T_{eq}+\Delta T_{GHE}</mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_Ts" number="yes">T_s\amp =\left[\frac{S(1-A)}{4 \sigma}\right]^{1/4} + f(H_2O, CO_2, CH_4, N_2O)_{atm}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sun's output <m>S</m> and Earth's albedo <m>A</m> change naturally on scales of billions of years to months.
      The type and amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere naturally change on similar timescales,
      a variation we will look at closely over the course of this book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans can't change the Sun's output,
      and can change Earth's average albedo only slowly,
      but we sure can change the amount and kind of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere!
      Over the past 250 years or so,
      we have increased the effective concentration of such gasses in the atmosphere<fn>

      and extrapolated to 2020 CE using a linear regression of equivalent <m>CO_2</m> concentration over time.
