  <title>Water is weird</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Carbon, and carbon dioxide, are the molecular stars of this book.
      But the award for best supporting molecule must go to water.
      Water is a unique and wonderfully complex substance.
      For example,
      it is the only substance that naturally occurs on Earth's surface as solid,
      liquid and gas
      (<xref ref="fig_3_phase_water">Figure</xref>).
      Or this: the solid form of water (ice) is less dense than the liquid form,
      so the solid floats on the liquid.
      These behaviors are so normal to human experience most people are surprised to discover how abnormal that behavior really is Chemically,
      water is equally unusual, and can both dissolve,
      and dissolve into, a vast array of natural materials.
      Because of this,
      water naturally forms mixtures with everything from atmospheric gasses to biological molecules to mantle minerals.
      If Earth had substantially less water than we do,
      plate tectonics as we know it may never have started<fn>

      </fn> because mantle rocks would be too stiff to convect.
      But, even if Earth had just three times more water than we do,
      formation of the continental crust may have been inhibited,
      with profound implications for Earthly life and climate<fn>

      I admit that this article is at the very furthest edge of acceptability as a reference.
      It is a wild read!
      </fn>.
      So before we study the Hydrosphere<mdash/>the vast bodies of liquid water on Earth<mdash/>we need to understand a little about water,
      the molecule.
      Three aspects of water are particularly important for our study of Earth and its climate.

    <title>Water's odd thermodynamic properties and their climatological importance</title>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Melting and boiling temperatures</title>
      <p>
        Recall from Chapter 3 that elements in the same column of the periodic table have similar chemical behaviors.
        <xref ref="fig_wiw">Figure</xref> <em>(upper panel)</em>
        shows the melting and boiling points of five
        <q>dihydride</q>
        substances: water (<m>H_2O</m>),
        and the chemical analogues formed by sulfur (<m>H_2S</m>),
        selenium (<m>H_2Se</m>), tellurium (<m>H_2Te</m>), and polonium
        (<m>H_2Po</m>).
        Three trends are evident as the analogue's atomic weight approaches that of water: (1) Melting points of the analogous compounds decrease; (2) boiling points of the analog compounds decrease; (3) The
        <q>gap</q>
        between the boiling and melting points decreases dramatically,
        which means the liquid phase is stable over an increasingly small temperature range.
        You can use the diagram to predict the melting and boiling points of water by sketching in a straight line that approximates each trend until the line gets to 18 amu,
        the mass of water.
        You'll get about \SI{-83}{\degreeCelsius} for the melting point and \SI{-71}{\degreeCelsius} for the boiling point
        (the light-blue filled data points on the Figure).
        Students asked to do this in the classroom have an interesting reaction:
        they hesitate to sketch in,
        write down or even talk about their prediction,
        because they know it's wildly wrong!
      </p>
      <p>
        Water actually melts at \SI{0}{\degreeCelsius} and boils at \SI{100}{\degreeCelsius}, far higher temperatures than the chemical analogues.
        The temperature difference between the two<mdash/>\SI{100}{\degreeCelsius}<mdash/>is nearly 3 times the average of the analogues.
        These features have profound implications for Earth and its biosphere.
        Earth's average surface temperature happens to be at the lower end of the liquid stability range,
        guaranteeing that Earth's oceans are liquid, not ice or vapor.
        As we saw in Chapter 4, Earth's average surface temperature is maintained by a robust greenhouse effect,
        to which water vapor is the strongest contributor.
        This is possible only because Earth's surface temperature is close enough to the boiling point to allow some water to exist as gas in the atmosphere.
        Finally, life on Earth requires liquid water,
        which is possible at Earth's surface temperature only because of water's anomalous behavior.

      <title>Density</title>
      <p>
        The <em>lower panel</em> of <xref ref="fig_wiw">Figure</xref>
        shows the density of liquid water
        (solid line)
        and its analogue <m>H_2S</m>
        (dashed line)
        at temperatures just above their freezing points.
        Liquids typically get more dense as they cool,
        because the lower kinetic energy of the molecules allows them to pack more tightly together.
        This is shown nicely by the data for <m>H_2S</m>,
        which gets denser rapidly as temperature falls.
        Not so water.
        Water's density changes very little as it approaches freezing,
        and actually peaks at \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius}. Water is so weird it doesn't act like its closet chemical brethren.
        This particular behavior has profound implications for everything from figure skating to the ecology of freshwater lakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the temperate areas of the globe (See Figure 4.14),
        annual temperature cycles drive a process that recharges lakes and ponds with oxygen,
        a process possible only because water has that odd density maximum at \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius}. During the summer,
        strong sunlight, high air temperatures,
        winds and waves all conspire to warm and mix the upper surface of the lake.
        A sharp temperature change, called the thermocline,
        separates this less dense surface layer from the deeper,
        colder, denser water below.
        The stratification induced by the density differences effectively cuts off the deeper water from the atmosphere.
        Over the summer the deep water slowly looses oxygen (<m>O_2</m>) as organisms consume it,
        this leads to an gradual increase of nutrients in the deep water as well.
        As autumn rolls around, air temperatures drop,
        and the upper layer cools more rapidly than the deep water,
        and eventually the pond becomes isothermal,
        the same temperature throughout.
        At this point, all the water had the same density,
        stratification disappears, and waters can
        <q>turnover</q>
        from top to bottom.
        The <m>O_2</m>-rich surface waters mix with the nutrient-rich bottom waters,
        leading to ideal conditions for life throughout the lake.
        As winter approaches,
        surface waters cool more quickly than the deeper waters,
        and once cooler than \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius}, these less dense water caps the lake,
        yet again establishing a stable, stratified lake.
        Eventually the densest water,
        at \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius}, sinks to the bottom,
        where it will sit for the remainder of the winter.
        Perhaps the lake's surface freezes,
        but because ice is less dense than liquid water,
        it floats to the lake top, capping off the lake from further cooling.
        Animals in the lake stay warm, the lake stays liquid,
        and all wait patiently until spring, where melting, heating,
        and overturning again renew the lake's water,
        setting the cycle up for the coming summer.
        Water's weirdness makes all of this possible.
        If ice were denser than liquid water,
        lakes and ponds would freeze from the bottom up,
        overturning would be rare, and life might be absent from lakes and ponds.

      <title>Heating, melting and evaporation energies</title>
      <p>
        Most readers have thrown ice in a cooler to keep something cold,
        or waited for water to boil to make a beverage.
        The idea that ice keeps thing cold or water takes a while to boil is so...normal...we don't question it.
        But yet again water is weird,
        in this case moderating temperature changes by being an energy hog.
        Raising the temperature of \SI{1}{\gram} of water takes about twice the amount of energy as raising the same mass of just about any other liquid.
        Water's high heat capacity allows it to absorb significant heat without changing temperature significantly.
        As we'll see below,
        the oceans have absorbed the vast majority (90%, see<fn>
        Cheng, L., Trenberth, K. E., Fasullo, J., Boyer, T., Abraham, J., &amp; Zhu, J. (2017).

        </fn>) of
        <q>extra</q>
        heat trapped by the Earth over the past few centuries.
        The high heat capacity of the oceans has moderated heating of the oceans,
        and greatly reduced the heating of the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps in middle or high school you did the classic experiment of looking at the temperature of a mixture of water and ice as the mixture was heated.
        You were probably surprised to find that the temperature of the water stayed right at \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius} until the last bit of ice melted.
        Rather than raising the system's temperature,
        that heat was breaking bonds between water molecules in the ice.
        The energy needed to melt \SI{1}{\gram} of substance, the
        <q>heat of fusion,</q>
        is a characteristic of every substance,
        and perhaps not to your surprise water is yet again a standout,
        with one of the highest heats of fusion of any liquid.
        A similar concept involves the transition from liquid to vapor (the
        <q>heat of vaporization</q>
        ) and water's is yet again uncommonly high.
        The latter trait is particularly important for climate.
        Every kilogram of water evaporated from the ocean surface requires the same amount of energy contained in \SI{200}{\milli\litre}
        (more than <m>3/4</m> cup)
        of gasoline.
        Recall that energy is never destroyed;
        the energy of vaporization travels with the water vapor into the atmosphere,
        and is released when the vapor condenses into rain.
        This is the energy that drives thunderstorms and hurricanes.

    <title>Hydrogen bonding as their explanation</title>
    <p>
      All of these oddities of water are due to
      <em>hydrogen bonding</em>.
      Hydrogen bonds form between hydrogen atoms in one molecule and another atom
      (typically oxygen or nitrogen)
      in a neighboring molecule.
      Unlike the better known covalent and ionic bonds,
      hydrogen bonds are weak and can be fleeting.
      Despite this,
      the sheer number of hydrogen bonds in water makes water weird<fn>
      Stokely, K., Mazza, M. G., Stanley, H. E., &amp; Franzese, G. (2010).
      Effect of hydrogen bond cooperativity on the behavior of water.
      Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 107(4), 1301-1306.
      </fn>.
      Atoms in the upper right corner of the periodic table,
      such as oxygen and nitrogen,
      have far greater affinity for electrons than hydrogen atoms.
      The resulting <m>O-H</m> or <m>N-H</m> bonds are asymmetrical,
      with electrons preferentially crowding the oxygen and nitrogen atoms.
      As a result, oxygen atoms have a partial net negative charge
      (as shown by the Greek letter delta
      <m>\delta^{\-}</m> in <xref ref="fig_H_bonding">Figure</xref>)
      and their bound hydrogen atoms have a small net positive charge<fn>
      Chaplin, M. (2017, August 5).
      Hydrogen bonding in water.
      Retrieved August 14, 2017, from

      </fn>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Water is a perfect environment for the formation of hydrogen bonds.
      The slightly positive hydrogen atom from one molecule slides up to the slightly negative oxygen atom of an adjacent molecule,
      a process repeated by every hydrogen and oxygen atom in the liquid.
      At low temperatures, each water molecule has
      (on average)
      four hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules,
      double the number of strong covalent bonds in the molecule itself.
      Water, on a microscopic scale,
      looks more like a pyramidal arrangement of 5 water molecules,
      connected by weak and constantly shifting hydrogen bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this hydrogen bonding makes <em>liquid</em>
      water particularly stable relative to the <em>solid</em>
      and <em>gaseous</em> forms,
      explaining the high freezing point of water,
      and the wide temperature range of its occurrence,
      noted in <xref ref="water_emp">section</xref>.
      As water cools toward freezing,
      the hydrogen bonds shift the geometry of the water molecules themselves,
      allowing them to pack slightly closer together,
      a geometry destroyed by further cooling,
      thus explaining the density maximum noted above.
      Finally, heating and vaporizing water takes so much energy because all those hydrogen bonds have to be broken.
      The analogues of water we looked at earlier-the
      <q>dihydrides</q>
      are all much larger than water,
      and have different angles between the hydrogens,
      which makes the hydrogen bonding far weaker than in water.
      Water owes its odd behavior directly to hydrogen bonding.
