    <title>Origins</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        <q>Where did you grow up?</q>
        is the first question most of us ask of a new acquaintance.
        Origins tell much about a person,
        and even more about planets.
        The origin of our Solar System in general,
        and of Earth in particular,
        places important constraints on the composition,
        structure and behavior of the planet.
        The manner and speed of Earth's formation largely determined its gross structure and fate.
        The place of formation, our orbit about the Sun,
        determines the heat we receive from the Sun and hence our climate;
        oscillations in this orbit produce everything from the day-night cycle every 24 hours to Ice Ages every 100,000 years.

      <title>Earth is old: Deep time and its implications</title>
      <p>
        A time span like 100,000 years is incredible by human standards.
        But Earth and the Solar System are old.
        That incredible-sounding 100,000 years is the same proportion of the age of Earth as 12 minutes is to a year.
        Before we can appreciate Earth's formation and structure,
        we need to understand deep time and the age of Earth.
        As we will see in the following sections,
        meteorites contain mineral grains that define the age of Earth and the Solar System.
        Painstakingly precise measurements of naturally occurring U and Pb in these grains shows they formed 4.567 billion years ago,
        with an uncertainty of just 0.0005 billion years.
        This age comes from the same meteorite pictured in <xref ref="allende">Figure</xref>.
        Holding this meteorite in one's hand is a heady experience:
        one is holding a rock that reaches beyond the foundation of our planet.
        The same careful research that gives the age of these earliest mineral grains clearly indicate that most of the planets
        (the exception being Earth)
        had formed within a few million years of the Solar System's birth.
        A few million years seems like a long time to those of us with lifespans measured in decades,
        but in the realm of geology, a few million years is quite brief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time so important that an analogy is warranted.
        One year is 365 days, 8760 hours,
        roughly half a million minutes, and so on.
        Imagine squeezing those 4.567 billion years of Earth history into one calendar year.
        <xref ref="tab_timeanalogy">Table</xref>
        gives the result of this analogy.
        For example,
        a time span of 100 million years is to Earth's age as 8 days is to a calendar year.
        Most Spring Breaks are about 8 days long,
        and chances are most students find that week to be fleeting.
        So, too, with 100 million years for the Earth.
        Memorable, yes, but all too brief.
        The Earth is old,
        and processes we short-lived humans think glacially slow can re-shape our planet in the blink of an eye.
        (The blink of an eye, the duration of that single event,
        is equivalent to 10 years in our analogy.
        For most college students two eye blinks are a lifetime.)

      <p>
        We need to take time for one other matter before continuing.
        Earth scientists routinely discuss both <em>when</em>
        some event happened in Earth's history,
        and the duration of that event.
        The age of event, the time when something happened,
        will always be given in units of years ago,
        or <em>annum</em>, abbreviated <em>a</em>.
        The deep history of Earth requires we have handy abbreviations for old ages,
        so we will use giga-annums (Ga),
        mega-annums (Ma) and kilo-arnnums (ka) for dates in billions, million,
        or thousands of years, respectively.
        Earth's age is thus 4.567 Ga, while most dinosaurs went extinct 66.04 Ma, roughly 66 million years ago.
        Durations get a different unit:
        <em>years</em>, abbreviated <em>yr</em>,
        but use the same pre-fixes.
        We will see below that most of the planets in our Solar System formed in just 4 to 6 million years,
        or 4-6 Myr.

      <p>
        Earth is one of eight planets,
        a handful of dwarf planets,
        and millions of asteroids and other minor bodies orbiting our Sun.
        <xref ref="fig_solsys1">Figure</xref> shows an accurate image
        (not a photograph)
        of the architecture of the Solar System,
        while a schematic view is given in <xref ref="fig_solsys2">Figure</xref>.
        Closest to the Sun are the four Earth-like,
        or <em>terrestrial planets</em>, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.
        All are small spheres of rock and metal,
        with little or no atmosphere and few or no moons.
        Farther from the Sun are the <em>gas and ice giants planets</em>, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
        As their name implies,
        these planets are massive planets (Jupiter has 300 times the Earth's mass) with enormous atmospheres of hydrogen,
        helium and ices, and have dozens of moons
        (<xref ref="fig_sizes">Figure</xref>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Three,or maybe four,
        belts of tiny bodies are scattered throughout the Solar System.
        These small planetesimals are remnants from the formation of the Solar System at 4.567 Ga.
        The <em>Main Asteroid Belt</em>
        between Mars and Jupiter contains over half a million planetesimals,
        ranging in size from the minor planet Ceres
        (<xref ref="fig_ceres">Figure</xref>, lower left)
        to boulders a meter across
        (<xref ref="fig_MBA">Figure</xref>).
        Meteors glimpsed in Earth's atmosphere are largely chunks of these asteroids;
        meteorites (such as those shown in Figures {fig:allende}) are meteor fragments that survive the fiery,
        brief passage through our atmosphere.
        Thousands of these fragments have been collected and analyzed,
        and provide detailed data on the very materials from which Earth formed.
        The Edgeworth Kuiper Belt is the next belt of tiny bodies,
        and lies just outside the orbit of Neptune.
        Pluto, that favorite minor planet,
        is one of the larger and the best-known object in this EKB. Finally,
        the Solar System is surrounded by the \:O\:{o}rt Cloud,
        a belt of icy objects so far from the Sun that the occasional passage of a distant star can perturb one of the \:O\:{o}rt objects into the inner Solar System,
        where it warms, evaporates, and fleetingly becomes a comet.
        Recent discoveries have begun to reveal a fourth potential belt of objects between the Edgeworth Kuiper Belt and the \:O\:{o}rt Cloud<fn>

        These
        <q>Extreme Kuiper Belt Objects</q>
        may include a massive, Neptune-sized planet lurking at the edge of the Solar System,
        a planet so far from the Sun that no one has ever seen it.
        This exciting idea will remain the focus of intensive research for decades.

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Geometry</title>
      <p>
        Three aspects of the planets' orbital geometry provide important evidence for the Solar System's formation.
        First, as Figure {fig:solsys2} shows,
        the planets' orbits all lie in a plane,
        rather than being randomly distributed around the Sun.
        Second, all the planets,
        minor planets and asteroids orbit counterclockwise around the Sun,
        and the vast majority rotate counterclockwise about their axes.
        Finally, the size and compositional differences between the Terrestrial and Gas/Ice Giants indicates that not all planets are created equally.
        This hints that the Solar System formed from a counterclockwise-spinning cloud of gas and dust.
        This much was hypothesized in the <m>18^{th}</m> Century by three different
        <q>natural philosophers,</q>
        what we would call `scientists.
        But confirmation and precise development of the details of this Nebular Hypothesis really only happened in the past two decades,
        with the development of new technologies
        (particularly the Hubble Space Telescope)
        which provided the first striking evidence of the formation of other solar systems.

      <title>Molecular clouds: the birth places of stars</title>
      <p>
        <xref ref="fig_pillars">Figure</xref>
        is Hubble Space Telescope photograph of stars and their associated planetary systems in the throes of formation within a giant molecular cloud.
        The pillar is a nebula composed of molecules of
        <em>hydrogen and helium gas</em>,
        miniscule fragments of minerals called <em>dust</em>,
        and frozen water and other volatile compounds
        (all called <em>ices</em>, regardless of composition).
        Hot, newly formed stars
        (the pinkish objects with
        <q>spikes</q>
        )
        are evaporating the gas, dust and ices into the whitish tendrils.
        The gravity of still-forming stars creates a dense cocoon of material resistant to this evaporation,
        and produce the dozens of knots seen in the photograph.
        These are other solar systems forming in real time,
        in front of our very eyes.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Proto-Planetary Disk: the birth places of planets</title>
      <p>
        Within each knot is a still-forming proto-star.
        As the proto-star's gravity pulls gas,
        dust and ice toward it, the material naturally forms a flattened disk
        (<xref ref="fig_ppdisk1">Figures</xref>
        and <xref ref="fig_ppdisk2"></xref>),
        with abundant material in the middle central plane, and less above and below.
        This proto-planetary disk is the birthplace of planets<fn>
        Williams, J. P., &amp; Cieza, L. A. (2011).
        Protoplanetary disks and their evolution. arXiv preprint arXiv:1103.0556
        </fn>.
        As the dust and gas are pulled to the central plane of the disk and the proto-star,
        they naturally begin to spin faster all in one direction.
        This affect of the conservation of angular momentum is spun on a chair and retracted one's arms,
        or watched an ice skater spin faster as they draw their hands in to their body.
        This is why all the planets in our Solar System have counter-clockwise orbits in the same plane,
        and why most spin counter-clockwise on their axes.
        The material also warms as it approaches the proto-star.
        Proto-stars are volatile and energetic,
        blowing away the gasses and melting the ices from the area near the star.
        This leaves dust as the only stable material in the central plane close to the star
        (the red-shaded areas in <xref ref="fig_ppdisk2">Figure</xref>).
        The location where the disk goes from gas and ice poor to gas and ice rich has the wonderful name of the
        <q>snow line.</q>
        Dust makes up only about 2% of the nebula
        (<xref ref="tab_ppneb">Table</xref>),
        so inside the snow line,
        planets will tend to be rocky and small,
        like the terrestrial planets.
        Beyond the snow line, planets can make use of the gas and ice,
        so they grow to massive gas and ice giants.
        The snow line was originally near the current position of the Main Asteroid Belt<fn>

        </fn>.
        To first order,
        these observations explain the large scale structure of the Solar System.
        The exclusion of ice and gas inside the snow line wasn't perfect,
        as you attest to.
        Ices were the primary source of water,
        carbon and nitrogen to the Earth, and that water,
        carbon and nitrogen is crucial to the development of life.
        The sources of Earth's water and other ices remains a mystery,
        which we'll examine in more detail below.

    <title>Accretion and Formation of Earth and the other planets: Fast, hot and melty</title>
    <p>
      Soon after the first dust grains in the Solar System formed (at 4.567 Ga, these grains make up much of the Allende meteorite seen in <xref ref="fig_allende">Figure</xref>),
      they began to coagulate together.
      Throughout the Solar System these grains grew from microscopic sizes into pebble-sized objects,
      which collided and merged to form planetesimals 10 to 100s km across
      (<xref ref="fig_jakob1">Figure</xref>
      and <xref ref="fig_jakob2"></xref>).
      All this colliding was an energetic affair,
      with millions of collisions and impacts
      (<xref ref="fig_hfm">Figure</xref>)
      necessary to build an average planetesimal.
      During an impact,
      a portion of the collision's kinetic energy would be converted to heat (Chapter 3) raising the temperature of the newly-enlarged planetesimal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combined with the decay of radioactive material in the planetesimals,
      this collisional heating began to melt the small and still growing objects.
      With more collisions came more heating, and more melting,
      and soon the objects began to segregate into distinct layers,
      or shells.
      This <em>differentiation</em> began 1-3 Myr after the initial formation of the Solar System.
      The rock particles in the dust had a far higher melting point than metal<fn>
      Rubie, D. C., &amp; Jacobson, S. A. (2015).
      Mechanisms and Geochemical Models of Core Formation. arXiv preprint:1504.05417.
      </fn> so the metals melted first,
      and being denser they slowly fell to the planetesimals' center.
      Eventually the rock in the mantle melted too,
      forming a planet-wide layer of molten rock,
      a magma ocean, which grew deeper as the object grew.
      At the surface, the magma cooled to form hardy rocky crust
      (<xref ref="fig_hfm">Figure</xref>).
      The resulting differentiated body had a thin, cold rocky crust;
      a warm magma ocean, a warm, rocky mantle;
      and a hot, molten iron core.
      (The structure has a passing relationship to the peanut version of a popular chocolate with a brightly colored candy shell.)
      All those minor objects orbiting the Sun in the Main Asteroid Belt, Kuiper Belt and \:O\:{o} cloud are all relics of this period of our Solar System's formation.
      Meteorites are so scientifically valuable because they are fragments of these ancient objects<mdash/>they contain abundant evidence for the earliest differentiation and melting of planetesimals.
      We don't have to guess about the formation and differentiation of planetesimals:
      we have pieces of them!
    </p>
    <p>
      About 5% of all observed meteorite falls are metallic meteorites
      (<xref ref="fig_ironmets">Figure</xref>).
      These represent the cores of layered planetesimals fragmented by a later collision.
      Less than 0.5% of falls are pallasite meteorites.
      These spectacular rocks consist
      (<xref ref="fig_pallasite">Figure</xref>)
      of the common mantle mineral olivine
      (the unsurprisingly green material in <xref ref="fig_pallasite">Figure</xref>)
      floating in a matrix of now hardened metal.
      These meteorites may preserve the core-mantle boundaries from planetesimals,
      but may also record mantle olivines from a large body mixed with the sinking core<fn>

      </fn> of a smaller planetesimal,
      as shown in the lower right quadrant of <xref ref="fig_hfm">Figure</xref>.
      Regardless, pallasitic meteorites show that differentiation was early and common.
      This process determined that the fate of all the Terrestrial planets was to be layered.
      Earth was born of embryos that had differentiated into layered bodies,
      and so Earth is, too.
      Earth still has this core-mantle-crust structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      As shown in <xref ref="fig_jakob1">Figures</xref>
      and <xref ref="fig_jakob2"></xref>,
      the already differentiated planetesimals collided and merged into ever larger
      (and differentiated)
      embryos up \SI{4000}{\kilo\metre} (2500 miles) across,
      objects roughly the size of Mars.
      Good evidence suggests that embryos that large had formed within 3 Myr of the start of accretion!
      The embryo that would become Earth grew quickly within the inner Solar System,
      reaching about 90% of its present mass in \SI{40}{100} Myr.
      (Remember that 70 Myr in Earth's history is equivalent to 5.5 days in one year.)
      At about this time, an embryo about the size of Mars struck Earth,
      perhaps with a glancing blow.
      The collision was catastrophic for the embryo, Theia, and nearly so for Earth.
      Based on detailed computer modeling of the event,
      the collision disrupted Theia,
      vaporizing much of the mantle of both planets<fn>

      forming a planet-wide <em>magma ocean</em>
      that would have boiled off any water lucky enough to have made it to the surface.
      Earth was knocked to its side during the collision,
      giving rise to the obliquity
      (axial tilt)
      that gives us our seasons.
      After this collision, Earth's formation was largely done.
      Except for the volatiles.

      Volatile elements are those that have low boiling points,

      as gasses.

      </fn> brought water and other volatile elements to Earth.
      This was no gentle summer's shower.
      Millions of undifferentiated objects crashed into the Earth,
      delivering water and other biologically important elements to Earth's surface.
      The impacts were sufficiently large and energetic enough to till Earth's surface,
      repeatedly folding,
      melting, and mixing the upper 20 to 30 km of the crust.
      Over the next few hundred million years, Earth gained volatile gasses and liquids from this late veneer of meteorites.
      A few samples of the Earth,
      tiny crystals of a mineral called zircon, survive from this time.
      These fragments provide good evidence that oceans
      (the primary component of the hydrosphere)
      existed, at least episodically,
      within <nbsp/>200 Myr of Earth's formation.
      For the next few 100 Myr,
      the occasional large impact would boil off part of the ocean,
      and perhaps the entire ocean,
      into the atmosphere, but Earth's formation was largely done.
      Earth had an atmosphere, a hydrosphere,
      and a differentiated geosphere.

      What about the biosphere?
      All those meteorite impacts and their after-effects would have sterilized any nascent biosphere on the early Earth.
      The biosphere probably hadn't developed when,
      about 400 Myr after formation, Earth was once again pelted by large meteorites,
      ones jostled out of the Asteroid Belt by a roving Jupiter.
      You can see the scars from this
      <q>Late Heavy Bombardment</q>
      tonight, if the Moon is out.
      Look (<xref ref="fig_moon">Figure</xref>) for the dark maria on the surface;
      these plains of volcanic rocks are the scars of impacts on the moon from the same period.
      Earth sufered the same intense bombardment,
      but nearly 4 billion years of energetic weathering and tectonics have erased any record of those impacts on the planet.
      This last blasting of Earth's surface again frustrated development of the biosphere.

      but their figure 3 suggests that flux was <nbsp/>10% of initial intensity by 3.7 Ga.
      Close enough for our needs here.]
      </fn>,
      life appears to have evolved quickly,
      within a few 100 Myr of the end of the bombardment.
      Earth's complement of spheres is complete.
