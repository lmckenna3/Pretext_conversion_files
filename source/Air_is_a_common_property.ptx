      You've probably never lived through the type of killer smog that settled over Donora, Pennsylvania in October, 1948.
      For a few days before Halloween,
      an atmospheric temperature inversion created a
      <q>lid</q>
      over the valley,
      trapping the exhaust from the mills lining the town's river.
      Over 4 days the concentrated pollutants from those mills killed 20 mostly elderly people and sickened nearly half the residents<fn>

      These disasters are essentially absent now in the United States and other developed nations because of laws,

      The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has even devised an Air Quality Index (AQI), which indicates the relative unhealthiness of polluted air,
      as determined from the concentrations of five pollutants regulated
      (in the U.S.)
      by the <em>Clean Air Act</em>.
      An AQI of less than 50 is considered
      <q>good</q>
      quality air,
      while a reading over 300 indicates that the air is harmful to everyone,
      even healthy adults.
      The US Environmental Protection Agency AQI scale ends at 500.

    <title>Air pollution in Eastern China</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The residents of developing nations aren't so lucky as those in wealthier countires.
        Rohde and Muller report that
        <q>Air pollution is a problem for much of the developing world and is believed to kill more people worldwide than AIDS, malaria,
        breast cancer, or tuberculosis</q><fn>
        Rohde, R. A., &amp; Muller, R. A. (2015).
        Air pollution in China: Mapping of concentrations and sources.
        PloS one, 10(8), e0135749
        </fn>.
        Residents of eastern China suffer from air pollution so thick and pervasive it is visible from Earth orbit
        (<xref ref="fig_china_pollution_ab">Figure</xref>)
        and can easily be mistaken for fog
        (<xref ref="fig_china_pollution_c">Figure</xref>).
        Just as in Donora and London,
        the air in Beijing is filled with the byproducts of combustion and industrial production.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Local issues</title>
      <p>
        At the time <xref ref="fig_china_pollution_ab">Figure</xref> was taken,
        the AQI in this part of China was 341.
        Two days before, on January 12, 2013, AQI in Beijing was 775.
        Air pollution in Beijing is literary off-scale awful.
        Recall the London
        <q>killer fog</q>
        which contributed to the death of 4000 Londeners in just one week?
        Over 4000 Chinese citizens die <em>every day</em>
        from the pollution in Chinese skies<fn>
        Rhode and Muller, <em>op cit.</em>
        </fn>.
        This is equivalent to roughly 1.6 million Chinese deaths per year,
        at least during the period of Rhode and Muller's study in 2012.
        This mortality is largely due to microscopic particulate matter,
        less than \SI{10}{\micro\meter}
        (approximately <m>\frac{4}{10000}</m> inches)
        across
        (see <xref ref="fig_EPA_pm">Figure</xref>).
        Such particles,
        common in the exhaust plumes emitted by accelerating diesel-powered buses or trucks,
        lodge in the lungs and increase the risk of stroke,
        heart disease, lung cancer and respiratory diseases<fn>
        Rhode and Muller, <em>op cit.</em>
        </fn>.
        Over 80% of all Chinese people are exposed to particulate matter concentrations that exceed the levels healthy for
        <q>sensitive groups</q>
        in the population, such as the elderly and the young.
        Almost 40% of Chinese people are subjected to air in which the concentration of particulate material is dangerous to all people.

      <title>Local causes</title>
      <p>
        The source of all this pollution is combustion of fuels,
        largely coal and wood, in China.
        The energy released by this burning is used to generate power for industrial production,
        to generate electrical power,
        to heat homes, and to provide transportation.
        Coal burning alone is responsible for about 40% of all air pollution-related deaths in China,<fn>

        While the Chinese government has announced plans to strike
        <q>heavy blows</q>
        in the efforts to reduce air pollution<fn>

        </fn>, China still burns almost as much coal as th erest of the world combined.
        Chinese industries are also far less efficient than their western counterparts,
        emitting 6-30 <em>times</em> more pollution when accounting for the total value of goods made in each country<fn>

        </fn>.
        This reflects a fundamental difference between the Chinese economy and that of the United States.
        In the United States,
        manufacturing creates only 12% of the country's annual wealth,
        while in China this value is 3 times higher, approximately 38%<fn>
        Lin et al. quote 43% in 2006.

        <url href="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;series=NV.IND.MANF.ZS&amp;country=">Data Bank</url>
        has substantially lower values of 33% in 2007.
        I quote the average.
        </fn> This dominance is hardly surprising.
        China has become the largest manufacturer in the world,
        surpassing the United States in 2009.
        What might be surprising is that only 1/3 of all this manufacturing is actually consumed by the Chinese people:
        the rest is exported across the world<fn>

    <title>Transport to North America</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Manufactured goods aren't the only thing China exports to the United States.
        Winds carry significant quantities of the pollution in Chinese skies to Western North America.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Local issues</title>
      <p>
        This pollution has measurably worsened air quality in the western United States,
        and even forced cities in California to pay fines for violating the
        <em>Clean Air Act</em><fn>
        Hand, E. (2014).
        China blamed for US ozone.
        Science, 345(6202), 1233-1233.
        </fn>!
        The precise pollutant responsible for this was <em>not</em>
        PM, but ozone, O$_{ 3 }$, generated by industrial activity in China.
        The magnitude of this transport is remarkable.
        In the 20 years from 1990 to 2010, O$_{ 3 }$ concentrations dropped extensively across rural areas of the Eastern United States,
        reflecting the successful limitation of local O$_{ 3 }$ sources.
        In the western United States, 5 <em>times</em>
        fewer rural stations recorded decreases in O$_{ 3 }$.

    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Distant Causes</title>
      <p>
        Approximately 40% of the difference is due to O$_{ 3 }$ or its precursors produced in China and borne to the United States by westerly winds blowing across the Pacific.
        These winds and their trajectories are nicely shown in <xref ref="fig_O3_pac_winds">Figure</xref>,
        which traces particulate matter
        (most of it natural)
        being carried from eastern Asia to western North America.
        Despite the indirect trajectory,
        the illustration shows that air from China reaches the coast of North America in just days;
        ozone and other pollutants produced in China can last weeks in the lower atmosphere<fn>

        </fn>.
        Once they wash over North America,
        those pollutants inflict some costs on the local residents,
        both financial and personal.
        Chinese pollution is a hemispheric problem,
        an hypothesis well described as early as 2003<fn>

      <q>Trade</q>
      pollution and what local and distant now mean</title>
      <p>
        The residents of Donora, Pennsylvania suffered a terrible tragedy in 1948.
        Both the immediate cause and suffering of that disaster were
        <q>local</q>
        by any standard:
        emissions in one small town caused death and injury in that one small town.
        By 1952, the scale of the problem had grown:
        the entire city of London was bathed in smog,
        but still the cause of the pollution was well within the affected area.
        If you can order a phone charger on Monday,
        and have it shipped to your house in a few days from China,
        how is China
        <q>distant?</q>
        If the pollution generated by the manufacture of that charger reaches your house a few days later,
        how is your
        <q>local</q>
        environment not affected?
        Even as modern transportation and communication infrastructure allows inter-continental ordering,
        manufacturing and shipping to flourish, we find that
        <q>local</q>
        and
        <q>distant</q>
        have become fuzzy concepts.
        And so too have the ideas of harm and responsibility.
        Who's to blame for pollution in your backyard caused by a Chinese manufacturing plant making a phone charger for you?
        Can it be that anyone and everyone owns the atmosphere,
        but no one is responsible for it?
