      Energy is a surprisingly new concept in science,

      and the Industrial Revolution (think steam engines)<fn>

      Newton dismissed energy as unimportant
      (he was wrong),
      Albert Einstein immortalized energy as <m>E=mc^2</m>
      (he was right),
      but Nobel-prize winning physicist Richard Feynman said it best:
      <q>we have no knowledge [of what] energy is.

      We need to get right with what energy is
      (<xref ref="fig_turner_cute_little_bunny">Figure</xref>)
      before we can discuss how it moves and subsequently changes Earth's temperature.

      <title>Energy is the ability to do work</title>
      <p>
        Energy is ability to do things,
        to raise a mass against gravity,
        to slide rocks against friction,
        to expand gasses against the weight of the overlying atmosphere,
        to warm an object.
        A formal definition is that <em>energy is what allows work to be done</em>,
        where work is the action of moving an object against an opposing force.
        For us a simpler definition can work:
        <em>energy is ultimately what causes one part of Earth to move relative to another</em>.

      <title>The Size of Energy</title>
      <p>
        Get accustomed to energy by finding a filled one-liter bottle of water.
        Lift it <m>\SI{10}{\centi\metre}</m> (about 4 inches), pause,
        and then lower the bottle gently to its initial location.
        That action requires energy, because you were moving the water against gravity.
        The amount of energy you used
        (in each direction)
        was <m>1</m> Joule, symbolized as <m>\SI{1}{\joule}</m>.
        This is the same amount of energy consumed in one heartbeat.
        An average college-aged person walking at average speed on level ground uses <m>\SI{100}{\joule/second}</m> as they walk<fn>
        V. Smil, <em>Energy in Nature and Society</em>, 2008, Cambridge, MIT Press, pg. 135
        </fn>.
        That same person should consume<fn>
        HHS/USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010
        </fn> about 2400
        <q>Calories</q>
        per day, which is equivalent to <m>\SI{1d7}{\joule/day}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding climate requires understanding energy,
        and that means we need a scale,
        a <em>joulestick</em>, for energy.
        <xref ref="tab_joulestick">Table</xref>
        lists the energy of various natural and man-made events.
        The energies range from the relatively small
        (the solar energy hitting <m>\SI{1}{\meter\squared}</m> of area at the top of Earth's atmosphere)
        to the almost incomprehensibly large
        (the total solar energy absorbed by Earth in one year).
        Values of this magnitude and range are difficult to understand,
        let alone use,
        so the third column of <xref ref="tab_joulestick">Table</xref>
        provides a useful way of scaling these numbers.
        As noted above,
        the average young adult consumes about <m>\SI{1d7}{\joule/day}</m> of energy each day.
        Assume that in an instant of maniacal effort you expend that amount of energy in 1 second of time.
        Then the energy in a ton of crude oil would represent 1 hour,
        and the total energy in all easily extractable fossil fuels represents <m>\SI{130}{\mega\year}</m>.
        While using this book, use <xref ref="tab_joulestick">Table</xref>
        to put energy into a context that you can use.
        For example, the next time you sit down to dinner, think about
        (but do not try!)
        to eat a day's worth of food in 1 second.
        If you did that,
        the annual amount of solar energy absorbed by Earth represents 12 billion years,
        or roughly the age of the Universe.
        The sheer magnitude of this values indicates that energy flow between Earth's spheres is dominated by solar energy.

      <title>Potential and Kinetic Energy</title>
      <p>
        For our purposes,
        all energy can be classified as either potential or kinetic energy.
        <em>Kinetic energy is that contained in the motion of an object</em>,
        and is proportional to the square of the object's speed.
        Any object at rest has zero kinetic energy,
        a detail that will become important when we discuss temperature.
        Objects that vibrate,
        such as the bob of a pendulum or an atom in a molecule,
        have kinetic energy, too.
        <em>Potential energy is that stored in an object</em>,
        by virtue of its position (a rock perched high above a valley floor) or chemical structure
        (the energy stored in the bonds of a sugar molecule).
        Unlike kinetic energy, potential energy has no
        <q>zero</q>
        point.
        There's always somewhere lower a system can fall.
        Motion of water, air,
        rock and ice on Earth typically involves the exchange of one form of energy into another:
        as a raindrop <m>\SI{100}{\meter}</m> above Earth's surface falls ground-ward,
        its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy,
        some of which is passed to molecules within the atmosphere,
        raising their temperature ever so slightly.
        And for us, this connection between kinetic energy and temperature is crucial.

    <title>Temperature</title>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Temperature is the average kinetic energy of particles in a system</title>
      <p>
        Humans have a curious relationship with temperature, and always have.
        Perhaps the relationship is in our very DNA. Evolutionary biologist Daniel Liberman<fn>
        Lieberman, D. E. (2014).
        Human Locomotion and Heat Loss: An Evolutionary Perspective.
        In R. Terjung (Ed.), Comprehensive Physiology
        (pp. 99-117).
        Hoboken, NJ, USA: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. https://doi.org/10.1002/cphy.c140011
        </fn> has hypothesized that the earliest human's behaviors of
        <q>long distance walking and running created a selective advantage for [early humans] to dump heat effectively in hot,
        arid conditions....Humans are the sole species of mammal that excels at long distance trekking and running in extremely hot conditions.
        No horse or dog could possibly run a marathon in <m>\SI{30}{\degreeCelsius}</m></q>
        (<m>90^{\circ}</m> F).
        Even though toleration of high temperatures is in our genetic structure,
        humans ability to sense temperature is not particularly good.
        When we touch something that we think feels
        <q>cold</q>
        we are actually sensing energy flowing from our fingers to the object,
        what we feel as
        <q>hot</q>
        is just our skin sensing energy flowing,
        perhaps too quickly, into the body.
        So most humans have a somewhat muddled understanding of temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules or atoms in a system of interest</em>.
        This kinetic energy is contained in both translational
        (straight line)
        motion and vibrational motion (shaking) of the particles.
        Picture a tall glass of ice water,
        slowly being stirred to keep it well mixed.
        Both ice and water will be at the same temperature,
        and so water molecules in the liquid will have, on average,
        the same kinetic energy as the water molecules bonded together in the ice.
        Molecules in the liquid water will be translating and vibrating,
        while water molecules in the ice will just be vibrating.
        Many students incorrectly associate temperature with some concept of the amount or concentration of heat in an object.
        A simple thought experiment shows this interpretation must be wrong.
        Take an object with a uniform temperature and split it in two.
        Both halves will still have the same temperature as the original object,
        even though splitting the object should have
        <q>split the heat</q>
        in the objects as well.

      <title>Temperature scales and temperature changes</title>
      <p>
        Recognition of temperature as kinetic energy brings a startling revelation.
        An object whose particles are moving at high velocity will have a high temperature,
        which is simple enough.
        But now conduct a thought-experiment:
        what happens to the temperature of the object as the particles slow down?
        As the particles begin to slow,
        the system's temperature must decrease.
        But there is a lower limit to velocity: 0.
        Particles can't go slower than stopped,
        which means there must be a point at which temperatures can go no lower:
        absolute 0.
        On the Fahrenheit scale used in the United States,
        absolute 0 comes in at approximately <m>-459.7^{\circ}</m> F.
      </p>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Temperature Scales</title>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, that Fahrenheit scale is a problem.
          Fahrenheit's genius was building the first accurate mercury thermometer;
          his failure was choosing odd things to calibrate it.
          On the Fahrenheit scale,
          water at Earth's surface freezes at
          <m>32^{\circ}</m> F and boils at <m>212^{\circ} F</m>,
          for a range of <m>180^{\circ} F</m> between the two points.
          The metric system uses a more rational and reproducible scale for measuring temperature,
          defining the freezing point of water as
          <m>\SI{0}{\degreeCelsius}</m> and boiling at <m>\SI{100}{\degreeCelsius}</m>,
          for a range of <m>\SI{100}{\degreeCelsius}</m>.
          One degree on the Celsius scale is thus equivalent to 1.8 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale.
          As shown in <xref ref="fig_temp_scales">Figure</xref>
          and <xref ref="eqn_c2f">Equation</xref>, the oft
          (but unfairly!)
          loathed conversion formula between Fahrenheit and Celsius scales simply reflects these scale choices.
          That formula is
        </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <men xml:id="eqn_c2f">
        F=\frac{180}{100}\cdot  C+ 32=\frac{9}{5}\cdot C+ 32=1.8\cdot C+ 32
      </men>
      <p>
        On the Celsius scale,
        absolute 0 comes in at approximately <m>\SI{-273}{\degreeCelsius}</m>,
        which is still an arbitrary value.
        The Kelvin temperature scale fixes this problem,
        calling absolute zero <m>\SI{0}{\kelvin}</m>.
        (Note the lack of a degree sign in the Kelvin scale.)
        The Kelvin scale uses the same
        <q>size</q>
        of a degree as the Celsius scale,
        it just starts at absolute zero.
        Temperatures on the Kelvin scale are
        <q>natural</q>
        in the sense that they measure the temperature from a physically real 0.
        We will use both the Kelvin and Celsius scales in this book,
        and the ability to convert between them,
        and to the more familiar Fahrenheit scale is important.

        <title>Temperature Changes</title>
        <p>
          One last peculiarity of temperature conversions.
          The majority of climate studies involve changes or differences in temperatures,
          so much so that climatologists
          (and we)
          will use the Greek letter delta
          <q><m>\Delta</m></q>
          to mean a change or difference in a quantity.
          For example, global surface temperatures have, on average,
          changed by <m>\SI{0.8}{\degreeCelsius}</m> between 1880 and 2018 CE. What is this temperature change expressed in Fahrenheit?
          Many students will na&#xef;vely use the formula in <xref ref="tab_t_conversions">Table</xref>,
          or the shorthand <xref ref="eqn_c2f_appx">Equation</xref>,
          and confidently but incorrectly state that the difference is

      </paragraphs>

        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        The correct conversions of <m>\Delta T</m>
        (between any scales)
        omits any addition or subtraction term.
        Only multiplicative terms, which reflect differences in the
        <q>size</q>
        of the degree, matter.
        An analogy helps explain why.
        Imagine paying $10 for a $9 item, and $100 for a $99 item.
        The difference in either case is $1.
        Had you paid the bills with quarters,
        you would have received 4 quarters back in each case.
        Figure 3.07 shows another explanation of the concept,
        and <xref ref="tab_t_change_conversions">Table</xref>
        gives the conversion formulas.
        The importance of temperature changes in the study of climate change,
        and of converting such changes to more comfortable units,
        will prove important throughout the book.

      <title>Heat is energy flowing from here to there</title>
      <p>
        Rid yourself of all preconceptions you have about heat.
        Heat is a tough concept,
        and the history of the study of heat has filled many a book.
        Fortunately, a modern understanding of heat is straightforward:
        <em>heat is energy moving from one place to another</em>.
        A fundamental observed regularity of nature is that heat naturally moves from an area of higher temperature to an area of lower temperature,
        never the other way around<fn>
        A small technicality: the <em>net</em>
        heat flow is always from hotter to colder.
        </fn>.
        Refrigerators and air conditioners can break this law only because they are plugged in to an electrical outlet.
        The substantial energy they consume is required to move heat the
        <q>wrong</q>
        way.
        Nature is easier.
        Heat moving naturally into a system will do work on the system,
        increase its temperature, or both.
        Either way, the natural movement of heat will always be to average the temperature of all objects in a system.
        <xref ref="fig_sun_earth_sys">Figure</xref>
        now has increased meaning: Earth's average temperature must be between that of the Sun and space,
        as shown in <xref ref="fig_sun_earth_sys_temps">Figure</xref>.
        The same rule of natural heat flow will apply on Earth as well.
        A reasonable hypothesis is that Earth is warmer at the equator and colder at the poles.
        So we expect heat will naturally flow poleward,
        and this correct supposition will end up explaining the vast majority of Earth's climatic behavior.

      <title>How does energy get from here to there?</title>
      <p>
        Heat flows through one of four mechanisms,
        all of which you have experienced directly.
        All four mechanisms are important to some part of the Earth system,
        but two of them are crucial to every aspect of Earth's operations.
        A ranked list of the four heat flow mechanisms would be <em>radiation,
        convection, advection and conduction</em>.
        We'll explore each below.
      </p>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Radiation</title>
        <p>
          Temperature, as we learned above,
          is just the average kinetic energy of the particles in a system or object.
          In most objects, these particles are just molecules,
          all of which are vibrating rapidly.
          The vibration of electrons in these molecules causes them to emit energy as electromagnetic radiation.
          All objects emit electromagnetic radiation,
          but objects hotter than roughly
          <m>\SI{1000}{\kelvin}</m> emit light visible to the naked eye.
          This is easy to demonstrate: Find an incandescent light bulb with a visible filament,
          and turn the light on for a minute.
          Then turn off the light bulb,
          and watch the filament turn from bright yellow to a dull red and then finally appear to stop glowing.
          The filament is still hot and glowing,
          but in light of wavelengths humans can't see.
          Even your body emits radiation,
          as an infrared camera will easily demonstrate
          (<xref ref="fig_Hand_IR">Figure</xref>).
          Examples of heat flow by radiation are easy to find:
          sunlight falling on your face,
          the warmth on your hands from a fire,
          and fast-food tacos bathed in heat lamps are all examples of radiative heating in action.
          Open a Thermos or any insulated container and you'll notice the inner container is coated with a silvery metallic paint,
          which is designed to reflect the radiation from the liquid back in to the liquid to keep it warm or cold.
          Given that all objects with temperatures above <m>\SI{0}{\kelvin}</m> radiate some energy,
          and that all objects in the Universe <em>are</em>
          above <m>\SI{0}{\kelvin}</m>,
          all objects must radiate some energy.
          Go outside on a clear evening and look at the stars.
          What you see is the light radiated by the hot surfaces of those astronomically-distant suns.
          Dense hot objects, like stars and Earth,
          radiate and absorb energy perfectly,
          and so are called <em>black body radiators</em>.
          Their radiation not only contains heat;
          it contains information on their temperature as well.
          We'll investigate this important type of radiator further in the next section.

        <title>Convection</title>
        <p>
          Hot air balloons rise through the atmosphere because the density of the warmer air in the balloon is less than the density of the cooler air outside the balloon.
          This buoyancy force drives the balloon upward against the force of gravity.
          Convective heat transport happens in much the same way.
          <em>Convection occurs when a layer of fluid is heated from below or cooled from above.</em> The lower,
          warmer fluid is less dense than the overlying cooler fluid,
          and like the hot air balloon,
          the warmer fluid will rise through the colder material.
          As it rises, it cools, until it reaches the top of the layer,
          where it cools enough to sink and subsequently be replaced by warmer fluid continually rising from below.
          This process continues until the temperature difference between the upper and lower boundaries becomes small.
          The circulation of fluids during convection transports heat effectively,
          often in large,
          circulation loops as shown in <xref ref="fig_convection_final">Figure</xref>,
          panel C. These loops can form long rolls
          (<xref ref="fig_convection_in_a_cup">Figure</xref>.A)
          or cells (<xref ref="fig_convection_in_a_cup">Figure</xref>.B), and can even be found in a good,
          strong cup of coffee
          (<xref ref="fig_convection_in_a_cup">Figure</xref>.C).
          Even the apparently solid Earth undergoes convection.
          Over a time scale of millions to billions of years, Earth's mantle convects,
          exactly like a stiff liquid
          (<xref ref="fig_convection_final">Figure</xref>.D).
          As we'll see in Chapter 5, convection in the mantle is responsible for plate tectonics,
          which drives much of the Geosphere.
          Convection drives much of the motion in the atmosphere and oceans as well.
          Within Earth,
          convection is the predominant and most important mode of heat transport.

      </paragraphs>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Advection</title>
        <p>
          <em>Advection is heat transport by the bulk movement of objects.</em>
          Think ice dropped in to a glass,
          or a cold air mass moving into an area behind a cold front.
          <xref ref="fig_dust_africa">Figure</xref>
          shows a plume of hot dry air blowing from northwest Africa out into the North Atlantic Ocean.
          This movement is not due to buoyancy,
          nor does the flow form a continuous,
          closed loop, which distinguishes advection from convection.
          Instead movement of material during advection is driven by a variety of other forces,
          often external to the moving material.
          Another important distinction is that convection always involves vertical motion,
          either against or with gravity.
          Advection isn't driven by buoyancy,
          and so advection can happen in any direction,
          most importantly in the horizontal.

        <title>Conduction</title>
        <p>
          <em>Conduction is heat transferred by the vibration of,
          or collisions between, atoms and molecules in an object</em>.
          Imagine a line of balls connected by springs,
          and begin shaking one end of the line.
          This shaking represents an increase in the kinetic energy of that portion of the material.
          Bonds between the particles, represented by the springs,
          will slowly spread the kinetic energy down the line.
          Slowly is the operative word:
          conduction is a slow way of moving heat,
          and is most important in solid materials.
          This means that conduction is of lesser importance in the atmosphere and oceans than the other mechanisms we've discussed.
          In fact, conduction is really only important for our understanding of the role of the lithosphere in plate tectonics.
        </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <p>
        Ironically, conduction is probably the best-known form of heat flow,
        because it is important on human time and spatial scales.
        Take a look back at <xref ref="fig_convection_in_a_cup">Figure</xref>.
        Note the temperature of the spoon
        (at the 12 o'clock position)
        changes from warmer
        (represented by the green colors)
        to cooler
        (represented by the purple colors)
        along the length of the spoon.
        This is due to the conduction of heat along the spoon from the hot coffee into the cooler spoon.
        Different materials have different abilities to conduct heat,
        as anyone who has installed that annoying pink insulation in a house can attest.
        Insulation is designed to be a poor conductor,
        which is why installing it in a house is worth the annoyance.
        Window glass is an excellent heat conductor,
        and can be the single largest source of heat loss
        (or gain)
        in a building.
        Most modern building windows contain multiple layers of glass separated by a gas-filled gap.
        The gas is a poor conductor of heat,
        and reduces the heat lost or gained through the window.
        Such double- or tripled-paned glass is expensive to install,
        but drastically reduces long-term heating and cooling costs for the building.

      <title>Three fundamental observations integrate energy, heat and temperature</title>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Observation 1: Heat flows naturally from warmer to cooler areas</title>
        <p>
          This simple idea is profoundly important to all of science,
          so much so that is enshrined as the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
          A physical
          <q>law</q>
          is just an observed regularity of nature,
          an actual exception to which has not been observed.
          There is no other physical law so often misunderstood and abused as this one.
          The Second Law states that the <em>net flow of heat is from warmer to cooler areas</em>.
          It does not mean that no heat flows from a cooler reservoir to a warmer one.
          Earth radiates a small amount of energy in all directions,
          some of which is intercepted by the Sun.
          But the Sun radiates far more heat to Earth,
          and so the net flow of heat is from the Sun and to Earth,
          by a factor of about 270,000!<fn>
          After much canceling of common factors,
          the ratio is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures,
          <m>T</m>, of the bodies as
          <me>
            \left(\frac{T_{Sun}}{T_{Earth}}\right)^4
          </me>
          </fn>
        </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Observation 2: An object or system at constant temperature has equal incoming and outgoing heat flow</title>
        <p>
          This corollary to Observation 1 is clear to anyone who has tried to find a comfortable temperature while a passenger in a car or bus.
          The driver has the heat on high,
          so heat flow into the system is high.
          You in turn open a window to the colder exterior,
          allowing heat to flow out of the system,
          and maybe even allow some colder air to advect into the vehicle.
          The human body provides another example,
          although in this case some of the
          <q>incoming</q>
          heat is produced by the body.
          On a cloudy day you might be comfortably walking outside until the Sun pops from behind one of those clouds.
          The incoming solar energy warms your skin,
          and suddenly you are less comfortable.
          But this observation has global implications.
          Ignoring for the moment recent global warming, Earth has had roughly constant surface temperature for some time,
          which means Earth gets as much energy from the Sun as it emits into the vast cold of deep space,
          averaged over the long term.
        </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Observation 3: Anything that interrupts the flow of heat from a warmer object to a colder object will keep the warmer object warmer, longer</title>
        <p>
          Anyone who has used a blanket or sweatshirt can attest to this statement.
          That comforter you use on a cold night doesn't warm you<mdash/>it has no source of energy.
          What that comforter does is reduce the rate at which heat radiates from your body into the surrounding colder air.
          That comforter is a poorly conducting layer between you and the cold air,
          which slows the loss of heat.
          The aluminized blankets one sees on marathon runners do essentially the same thing,
          although they prevent radiative loss as well.
          Fortunately for the well-being of life on Earth,
          our atmosphere acts the same way,
          slowing the rate of heat loss at the surface lie an invisible blanket.
          This is the origin of the Greenhouse Effect.
