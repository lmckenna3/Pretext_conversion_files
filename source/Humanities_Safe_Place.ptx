      a realm where the machine runs predictably and with a low risk of sudden failure.
      A car, for example,
      can't be driven too fast for too long without damaging the engine;
      the human heart can't function well if the arteries are blocked by fatty deposits.
      Earth's climate is an especially complex system,
      and so we'd expect it too has boundaries.
      We are particularly interested in the boundaries that keep the climate operating in a way that is safe for humanity<mdash/>resistant to sudden changes or failures that would endanger the Anthroposphere's continuing existence.
      Just like running a car too hard,
      running the Earth through those boundaries risks moving climate out of a safe space for humanity.
      If virtue is the practice of moral excellence,
      then the first step to solving the collective action dilemma posed by climate change is to avoid crossing planetary boundaries,
      and leaving Earth in a safe operating space for humanity.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Societies and the humans in them need water, food,
        energy and raw materials to thrive.
        This requires healthy and well-functioning hinterlands.
        When human populations were small, so too were their needs.
        Over the course of the Holocene<mdash/>the climatic period extending over the past 11,700 years<mdash/>human population has increased by a factor of around 1400<fn>

        note that human population growth rates prior to the modern era
        <m>\approx1650</m> CE averaged <m>0.04\pm0.01\%/yr</m>.
        Given population at <m>1650\:CE\:(P_{1650})\approx0.5x10^9</m>,
        then <m>P_{9700\:BCE}=5x10^6</m> with a factor of 3 uncertainty.
        So the ratio <m>P_{2018}/P_{9700\:BCE}=1.4x10^{3\pm0.5}</m>

        Each modern person, on average,
        consumes about 15 times<fn>

        </fn> the raw materials as our early Holocene ancestors.
        Our hinterlands and wastelands are now 20,000 times larger than they were at the beginning of the Holocene Period!
        Our ancient ancestors couldn't possibly push the boundaries of the planet's ability to provide key services to us.
        We are.
      </p>
      <p>
        A large international group of scientists proposed the planetary boundary idea<fn>
        Rockstr&#xf6;m, J., Steffen, W., Noone, K., Persson, A., Chapin, F. S. I., Lambin, E., ... Foley, J. (2009).
        Planetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanity.
        Ecology and Society, 14(2).
        <url href="https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03180-140232">link</url>
        </fn> in 2009.
        Their idea was to identify conditions in Earth's various spheres the crossing of which might initiate rapid and even dangerous planet-wide environmental change,
        challenging human societies' survival.
        Think of each boundary as the edge of a hill leading to an unknown,
        but dangerous, chasm.
        Because changing behaviors is difficult,
        and systems can have inertia,
        it is best to draw the boundary before the steep downward sloping portion of the hill.
        <xref ref="fig_planet_bound_pot_surf">Figure</xref> sketches the idea,
        with safe operating spaces shown in green, a
        <q>warning area</q>
        in yellow, and a
        <q>danger area</q>
        in red.
        The planetary boundary itself is the boundary between the yellow and red areas.
        Rockstr&#xf6;m and his colleagues originally defined nine boundaries.
        Subsequent research and 8 more years of data indicates that only 7 of those original boundaries are essential for our purposes,
        and one new one is needed.
        Each boundary has a associated quantitative value attached to it,
        but only some of these are crucial for our story.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Climate Change</title>
      <p>
        Of course climate change is one of the boundaries!
        The
        <q>warning</q>
        and
        <q>danger</q>
        boundaries are drawn at <m>350\: ppm</m> and
        <m>500\pm50\:ppm\: CO_2</m> in the atmosphere respectively.
        October of 1988 CE was the last time carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere was
        <m>\lt 350\: ppm</m>; 30 years later concentrations have increased to 408 ppm.
        We are deep in the
        <q>warning zone</q>
        on this boundary,
        and we'll spend the remainder of this book examining the causes and solutions of this.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Ocean Acidification</title>
      <p>
        All that <m>CO_2</m> in the atmosphere leads to increased acidity in the world's oceans,
        as we noted above in <xref ref="sl_acid">section</xref>.
        <xref ref="fig_ocean_acidity">Figure</xref>
        shows this increase as measured in one representative area near Bermuda,
        where acidity is increasing by about 4% per decade.
        Increased ocean acidity makes shell-secretion harder for marine organisms,
        and so the warning boundary is 125% more difficulty in shell secretion than in 1750CE. We are current near 120% more difficult,
        and so are still in the green part of the boundary.
        At current rates of carbon dioxide emission,
        we will cross the boundary in about 60 years.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Net Plant Production</title>
      <p>
        At the base of all food webs lie plants.
        Terrestrial, or land-based,
        plants are particularly important in this regard,
        because they combine through photosynthesis water,
        <m>CO_2</m> and light from the Sun to form carbohydrates.
        <q>Net Plant Production,</q>
        or NPP, measures the net mass of new plant material growing each year.
        Although it may vary locally over the year (See <xref ref="fig_npp">Figure</xref>),
        the annual total varies by <m>\leq2\%</m> around <m>54x10^{12}</m> kg.
        To put that number in perspective,
        the mass of plant growth every year is about 100 times greater than the mass of
        <em>all</em> humans on the planet!
        Despite this enormous value, there's little variation in it,
        meaning that Earth's ability to produce plant mass is limited.
        And we, as a species, already appropriate<fn>

        </fn>, NPP is
        <q>the source of food,fiber, and fuel for humanity,</q>
        so the exceeding this boundary would be significant.
        While we are firmly in the
        <q>warning zone,</q>
        the proportion of NPP we use has been constant for the past 30 years,
        largely because of industrial-scale agricultural.
        This most fundamental of planetary boundaries will be threatened by all other boundaries,
        in ways that may be complex and unexpected.

      <title>Chemical Cycles</title>
      <p>
        Evidence for life on Earth is found in the oldest rocks geologist can find<fn>

        </fn>.
        Excellent fossil evidence demonstrates that microbial live existed as early as <m>3400\pm 50 Ma</m>,
        and somewhat more controversial evidence pushes the age back to <m>\approx 3700 Ma</m>.
        Whatever the precise date of its origin,
        life has thrived on our planet for nearly 4 billion years.
        All that life needs energy and chemical building blocks,
        most importantly the elements C, H, N, O, S and P<fn>

        The microbial engines that drive Earth's biogeochemical cycles.
        Science, 320(5879), 1034-1039.
        </fn> Life's long history on Earth is possible because those elements are continually cycled from the biosphere,
        into the geosphere, and then back into the biosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        These various cycles are energized by solar energy and the internal heat of the Earth.
        But small,unicellular microbes are the
        <q>machines</q>
        actually doing the cycling, converting the waste products of one life form
        (such as <m>O_2</m> from photosynthesis in plants)
        to reactants for another form (such as <m>)_2</m> for respiration in humans).
        Over the past 150 years,
        humans have collected vast quantities of N and P to use as fertilizers.
        These fertilizers have made it possible to feed billions of people,
        but at the cost of upsetting the delicate microbial machinery driving chemical cycles.
        Run-off from agricultural fields delivers N and P to the ocean,
        where the nutrients create
        <q>dead zones</q>
        in the oceans,
        potentially affecting the health of the very microbial life forms necessary to drive the cycles.
        Warning areas for release of P and N are the natural release rates.
        Danger areas are 180% and 130% of natural release rates respectively.
        As shown in <xref ref="fig_planet_bound">Figure</xref>,
        we have already pushed beyond the danger boundary,
        at roughly 225% for P and nearly 250% for N. This boundary is a particularly troubling one:
        growing sufficient food for 7.5 billion inhabitants seemingly requires N and P-containing fertilizers,
        but continued use of them may threaten the ecosystem's ability to provide those services.

    <title>Ecosystem Services</title>
    <p>
      <q>Ecosystem services</q>
      describes the various natural cycles and resources Earth processes provide to human societies.
      <xref ref="fig_circ_flow">Figure</xref>
      shows these services as the natural resources that underlie all human societies,
      and the natural recycling that converts human waste products back into resources.
      Without these services,
      human societies would lack the inputs we need not only to drive a healthy economy,
      but also to provide the very food and water we need for survival.
      The intimate relationship human societies have with ecosystem services suggests that once again we need to expand our concept of
      <q>group</q>
      to include those ecosystem services fundamental to our group's survival.
      Just as we argued in <xref ref="groups_global">Section</xref>
      that even distant peoples have
      <q>standing</q>
      as being members of
      <q>our</q>
      group, we now face the realization that we depend upon Earth systems for a functioning society.
      The idea that land, and even Earth itself, has moral standing,
      was first formulated by at least if one agrees that a functioning economy is important to society.
      The idea that land, perhaps even the Earth itself,
      has moral standing began in 1948,
      with the publication of <em>A Sand County Almanac</em>
      by the American author Aldo Leopold,
      and has continued to develop since then<fn>
      As examined by Callicott, J. B. (2014).

      </fn>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This moral standing sprouts from a spectrum of <xref ref="fig_eco_values">viewpoints</xref>.
      For example, many people may find an
      <em>instrumental value</em>
      in the Earth and its ecosystem services:
      there's monetary value in the resources one extracts in the hinterlands,
      and in services provided by wastelands.
      This viewpoint might be characterized as
      <q>Nature <em>for</em> me</q>
      Others may find <em>relational value</em><fn>
      Chan, K. M., Balvanera, P., Benessaiah, K., Chapman, M., Diaz, S., G'omez-Baggethun, E., ... &amp; Luck, G. W. (2016).
      Opinion: Why protect nature?
      Rethinking values and the environment.
      Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 113(6), 1462-1465.
      </fn> in Earth and its ecosystems: Earth provides personally- and culturally-important meaning to them.
      Think of this viewpoint as
      <q>Nature <em>and</em> me</q>
      Finally, some people think that Earth has
      <em>intrinsic value</em>: Earth itself has inherent worth.
      Think of this perspective as
      <q>Nature <em>for</em> Nature.</q>
      These various ways of finding value in Earth and its services are not mutually incompatible,
      and most people probably have a mixture of all three,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_eco_values">Figure</xref>.

    <title>Cost of breaching Planetary Boundaries</title>
    <p>
      Regardless of which value
      (or values!)
      you place on Earth and the ecosystem services it provides,
      everyone has them.
      At the very least, if you eat food or drive a car,
      you associate instrumental values with Earth.
      So now our circle of
      <q>ethical behavior</q>
      (<xref ref="fig_groups">Figure</xref>) has to expand again,
      to include the Earth and the ecosystem services it provides,

      Planetary boundaries
      (<xref ref="pbs">Section</xref>and <xref ref="fig_planet_bound">Figure</xref>)
      guard the gates of the a purely instrumental view of ecosystem services provided by Earth.

      <title>A brief review of where we have been</title>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="values_morals">Section</xref>
        we noted the necessity of discussing morals when discussing climate change.
        To fully understand why, we examined common pool resources
        (<xref ref="cprs">Section</xref>),
        collective action problems
        (<xref ref="collective_action">Section</xref>),
        how reputation in a

        and a potentially successful solution to the Tragedy of the Common
        (<xref ref="no_toc">Section</xref>).
        Then we examined planetary boundaries
        (<xref ref="pbs">Section</xref>),

      <title>And a suggestion on how to move forward</title>
      <p>
        Virtue is an old concept in both Western and Eastern civilizations,
        and essentially means an
        <q>excellent trait of character,
        coupled with a moral wisdom of understanding not only what is good,
        but how to achieve that good thing effectively<fn>
        Hursthouse, Rosalind and Pettigrove, Glen,
        <q>Virtue Ethics</q>, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),
        <url href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/ethics-virtue/">Link</url>.
        </fn>.</q>
        Most humans would agree that maintaining a
        <q>safe operating space</q>
        for humanity of the planet is a virtuous idea:
        the outcome itself is a
        <q>good thing,</q>
        and the way to do that effectively is to not blow through the planetary boundaries that allow continued ecosystem services.
        This idea might be called
        <q>planetary stewardship<fn>
        Jenkins, W. (2016).
        The Turn to Virtue in Climate Ethics: Wickedness and Goodness in the Anthropocene.
        Environmental Ethics, 38(1), pg 89, and references therein.
        </fn>.</q>
        As Jenkins notes,
        <q>stewardship shifts attention from protecting what nature <em>would be</em>
        without human interference to maintaining what is required for the long-term flourishing of humanity</q>. We noted in <xref ref="GCC_diff">Section</xref>
        that global change is a different sort of problem because each of our small contributions to the problem seem so inconsequential.
        But the virtue of
        <q>planetary stewardship</q>
        rescues each of us from that depressing fate.
        Virtue is about doing good in an effective way.
        And so we each get to choose how to contribute to the virtue of not
        <q>blowing through the boundaries.</q>
        Interestingly,
        virtuous behavior is an effective way of building reputation,
        which of course is needed to solve collective action problems.
