    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      Humans<mdash/>despite our marvelous diversity<mdash/>are all about the same size physically.
      When we first needed to measure things we used ourselves as rulers.
      Some of those measures were pretty straight-forward:
      the foot for example.
      But other measures-the yard
      (finger tip to nose)
      and the inch (a thumb width, try it)<mdash/>derive from us as well<fn>
      see Russ Rowlett's marvelous units of measure site,
      <url href="http://www.ibiblio.org/units/custom.html">Link</url>
      </fn>.
      Understanding things that don't happen at human scales
      (either in space or time)
      is difficult for most of us.
      So as we begin our study of perennial ice<mdash/>glaciers and ice sheets,
      the part of the Cryosphere that lasts more than a few years<mdash/>we have to remember that some things happen so slowly that fully understanding them takes time.
      After all, you've probably heard the expression
      <q>glacially slow!</q>
      Most perennial ice moves slowly under its own weight,
      typically around \SIrange{10}{100}{\metre\per\year}, or about 0.5 inch per hour.
      These slowly-moving ice masses range from tiny isolated glaciers trapped at the top of mountains to continent-spanning ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland
      (<xref ref="fig_perennial_ice_2">Figure</xref>).
      The ice sheets are the last surviving remnants of ice sheets that over the past few million years repeatedly spanned most of the northern continents,
      and may again in a few thousand years.
      The perennial Crysophere is all about long term differnce between mass gain and mass loss,
      so we begin our discussion there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as we saw with the seasonal cryosphere,
      our real interest in perennial crysosphere is how it interacts with climate.
      Ice sheets are so large their reflective surfaces change global albedo,
      their cold surfaces steer atmospheric circulation,
      and their mass stores 2% of all surface water.
      All of these are changing quickly,
      because this part of the cryosphere is also quickly melting as global temperatures rise.
      Seasonal snow is too thin to hold much water,
      and melting sea ice<mdash/>because it floats<mdash/>doesn't increase sea levels.
      But glaciers and ice sheets are largely terrestrial. hen they melt,
      their water raises sea level.
      As we saw in Chapter 5 (The Hydrosphere) meting glaciers and ice sheets could raise sea levels as much as \SIrange{1}{2}{\metre} by the end of the century,
      imperiling the homes of 2.5 to 3.5% of all humans<fn>

      Bias in the underlying data sources concentrates population counts at 1 and 5*n meter intervals; I modeled populations at \SI{0}{\metre} and \SI{1}{\metre} with a second order polynomial fit to observed populations at [2, 3, ...40] m elevation.
      Residuals were quite low,
      except for \SI{0}{\metre} and \SI{1}{\metre}, reflecting the counting artifacts in the data.

    <title>Mass balance and movement of ice</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Perennial ice is all about gain <em>versus</em> loss.
        Glaciers form when local snow fall during the winter exceeds melting in the summer.
        The snow eventually compresses to form ice,
        which flows downhill<mdash/>typically<fn>
        Marshall, op cit., page 163
        </fn> at \SIrange{10}{100}{\metre\per\year}
        (or about half and inch per hour!)
        under their own weight.
        At the bottom of the glacier,
        loss of ice by a variety of mechanisms just matches the forward speed of the glacier and it stops spreading downhill,
        reaching a point of dynamic equilibrium.
        If climatic conditions are stable,
        so too will the glacier's position and shape.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection xml:id="massgain">
      <title>Mass gain</title>
      <p>
        Snow fall from the atmosphere is essentially the only source of material to the glacier,
        so glaciers tend to gain mass at their higher elevations.
        In Chapter 4 The Atmosphere we saw that air temperatures change by <m>\approx</m>\SI{-6}{\kelvin\per\kilo\metre}, the upper reaches of glaciers are thus colder and,
        to first approximation, more likely
        <em>accumulate</em> mass as snow.
        During the summer,
        the lower reaches of the glacier will be warmer and hence will lose more snow to <em>ablation</em>,
        the summed melting of ice to water and sublimation of ice to vapor.
        The line where last winter's snow remains at the end of the summer melt season separates the area where the glacier is gaining mass
        (the accumulation zone),
        from the areas of the glacier losing mass
        (the ablation zone).
        The altitude separating these two areas<mdash/>different for different glaciers<mdash/>is the equilibrium line altitude and represents a sort of
        <q>pivot point</q>
        around which the glacier grows and shrinks.
        Over the course of a few centuries to millennia with relatively stable climate,
        the glacier develops an equilibrium profile
        (<xref ref="fig_ELA">Figure</xref>),
        with ice flowing in arcuate paths on its way down hill.
        At the glacier-rock interface,
        the glacier can slide along the rock,
        slip against a muddy layer, or even float along a layer of pressurized water.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Mass loss</title>
      <p>
        Mass gain in glaciers is pretty simple: snow from above.
        Mass loss is more complicated because there are multiple routes through which water
        (in any form)
        can exit glaciers and ice sheets.
        All glaciers lose ice through <em>ablation</em>, the sublimation
        (see Figure 3.12)
        of ice to vapor.
        In areas where air temperatures are relatively warm,
        such as on the Greenland Ice Sheet,
        melting of surface ice to form liquid water is an important loss mechanism.
        The impossibly sapphire water in <xref ref="fig_glacial_loss">Figure</xref>
        are ponds of glacial melt perched atop the GIS. This water finds its way
        (panel B),
        both above and below the ice surface, to the ocean.
        (One doesn't carry a water bottle when working on glaciers like this;
        you carry a cup slung to your backpack,
        dip it into a melt stream drink the coldest and most refreshing water on the planet.)
        Most glaciers are thick enough<fn>

        While melting is an important loss mechanism,
        it isn't as splashy as the best-known way glaciers lose mass: by

        icebergs.
        While it rankles a book author to say,
        no words or still pictures can adequately describe the awesome majesty of icebergs forming at the terminus of a glacier or ice shelve.

        Mountain glaciers

        and the impressive Aletsch Glacier in Switzerland (<xref ref="fig_mtn_glacier">Figure</xref>.
        Mountain glaciers form, as we saw above,
        where long-term mass gain exceeds long-term mass loss.
        Once large enough,
        glaciers flow downhill and up temperature until their flow is slower than their melt.
        Glaciers and climate are intimately connected,
        so the growth and retreat of glaciers provides an excellent monitor of long-term climate change.
        If climate cools, glaciers will grow,
        moving down-hill and inflating as colder conditions push the equilibrium line altitude downhill.
        In a warming climate, the opposite happens:
        the glacier melts, retreats up-hill and deflates<fn>
        Again words and still pictures are insufficient.
        The reader is urged to view time-lapse photography of this produced by the EIS, for example https://vimeo.com/5963395

        Glaciers are fierce eroders of rock,
        and a thick glacier rapidly and effectively carves its own valley with surprising ease,
        stripping the surface of vegetation, soil,
        and the smoothing the underlying bedrock.
        The Aletsch Glacier has been retreating and melting since about 1860 CE<fn>

      <title>Mountain glacier melting and sea level rise</title>
      <p>
        The reason we had to understand mass balance of glaciers before we even looked at a picture of glaciers is straightforward:
        global warming is melting glaciers all over the globe.
        As surface temperatures increase,
        the equilibrium line altitude of many glaciers is actually rising
        <em>above the highest point on the glacier.</em>
        Once this happens, the glacier is doomed.
        The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report noted that that at least 600 glaciers world-wide,
        have disappeared since record keeping began,
        and many more glaciers are begin to disintegrate.
        As we seen, glaciers grow or shrink unitl they reach equilibrium,
        so the observation that most glaceiers global are melting faster with time means that even if warming stiopped now,
        glaciers would continue to melt.
        Equilibrium is a long way away.
        Like the disappearance of sea ice, snow and permafrost,
        the local and regional implications of these changes are severe.
        For example, Glacier National Park in Montana is famous for its glaciers,
        but not for much longer.
        Only 17% of the glaciers in the Park present at the end of the <m>19^{th}</m> Century are left,
        and even those are expected to disappear within a few decades<fn>

        This will be a catastrophic loss to the local economy.
        At a local level,
        glaciers provide a significant portion of drinking water to many communities in the Andes and Himalaya,
        and the loss of these glaciers threatens the very survival of dependent communities.
        But at a regional level,
        glaciers in these areas provide the water used to grow food.
        Melting glaciers might seem like a good thing<mdash/>more water<mdash/>but the glaciers are <em>shrinking</em>,
        so in the long run less water is available for growing crops.

        These ice sheets are remnants of once vast sheets of ice that covered Antarctica,

        The most recent of these Ice Ages began 34 Mya,
        and is but the latest episode of a global glaciation,
        a subject we'll cover in more detail in Chapter 12.
        Both the Greenland and Antarctica retain ice sheets because they are high,
        dry and cold, except at their edges.
        Here we'll examine the contemporary and near future of these great ice sheets,

      <title>AIS</title>
      <p>
        Like the kid picked last for a team, Antarctica always seems to get regulated to the sidelines of maps,
        so <xref ref="fig_rel_size">Figure</xref>
        shows Antarctica, Greenland and North America overlaid and at the same scale.
        Appreciating the volume of ice in Antarctica requires multiple superlatives.
        At twice the size of the contiguous United States, Antarctica is 99% ice covered
        (<xref ref="fig_antarc_map">Figure</xref>, panel A).
        The Transantarctic Mountains separate East and West Antarctica,
        which each have their own ice sheets,
        with the majority of the ice lying in the Eastern Antarctic Ice Sheet.
        The Antarctic Peninsula has its own
        (relatively small)
        ice sheet, but the northern extremes of the Pennisula lack extensive ice sheets.
        As you can see from the cross section in <xref ref="fig_AISXC">Figure</xref>
        and <xref ref="tab_wti">Table</xref>,
        the average thickness of the AIS is an astonishing \SI{1900}{\metre} (6200 feet),
        five times the height of the Empire State Building.
        The deepest ice is more than \SI{4900}{\metre} (3 miles) deep and was most likely deposited in a snow storm more than a million years ago.
        Driving a snowmobile, sometimes for hours, across the ice sheet

        so vast are areas covered by ice.
        Oceans, indeed:
        melting the AIS would on average raise sea level by \SI{58.3}{\metre} (190 feet);

        Greenland<mdash/>the world's largest island<mdash/> is 80% covered by ice sheet and glaciers,
        with an average depth of \SI{1650}{\metre} (5500 feet).
        The Greenland Ice Sheet,
        like its larger Antarctic cousin,
        mantles bedrock topography over most of the island,
        (see <xref ref="fig_GISxsection">Figure</xref>),
        sinking the bedrock below sea level in the island's center.
        The high point of the ice sheet
        (somewhat unimaginatively named
        <q>Summit</q>
        )
        is near the deepest ice,
        one of the reasons international teams of glaciologists have drilled and recovered ice cores all the way to bedrock,
        over 3050 m deep.
        Like Antarctica,
        the Greenland Ice Sheet is drained by rapidly-moving outlet glaciers,
        shown by the red to purple colors in Panel B of <xref ref="fig_gis_physical">Figure</xref>.
        Greenland's largest glacier, Jakobshavn,

        This motion drives frequent iceberg calving at the front of the glacier,
        which eventually make their way into the Atlantic Ocean.
        Until recently, ice loss from the GIS was dominated by calving,
        as shown in <xref ref="fig_glacial_loss">Figure</xref>;
        but with Arctic Amplification

        ice loss from surface melting has begun to dominate loss in the GIS, which we'll discuss further below.
        This mass loss is important,
        as the sea level equivalent of the GIS is an astonishing \SI{7.4}{\metre} (24 feet),
        equivalent to <nbsp/>2 stories of the Empire State Building
        (<xref ref="fig_esb">Figure</xref>).
