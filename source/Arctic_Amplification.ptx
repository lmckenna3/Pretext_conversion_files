      Particularly outside the polar regions,
      the Cryosphere is only marginally stable has temperatures rise and fall on daily and seasonal cycles.
      Unlike all the other spheres,
      the Cryosphere variable over time and space.
      Superimposed on these cycles is the long term global warming,
      which is driving rapid, real-time erosion of much of the Cryosphere.
      Recall these variations as we tour the existing Cryosphere,
      keeping in mind that all these values are for this moment in Earth's long history.

      <title>Snow</title>
      <p>
        Occasionally the Cryosphere reaches in to the atmosphere,
        as snow and its brethren.
        As beautiful and tranquil as a snowfall can be
        (<xref ref="fig_snowfall">Figure</xref>),
        the processes leading to snow involve titanic forces in the atmosphere.
        Because the amount of water dissolved in air decreases exponentially with temperature, (Figure (reference to chapter 5)),
        most snow forms when relatively warm moist air is cooled to temperatures below freezing. (This is why snow is actually quite rare in perennially cold places,
        such as Antarctica!) the most common places to get this combination is in orographic uplift,
        and large, mid-latitude storm systems.
        Air cools as it rises,
        so air masses running up against mountains will cool as they lift over the mountains,
        dropping their water on the upwind side of the range.
        As you can see in <xref ref="fig_orographic">Figure</xref>
        the snow falls almost completely on the
        <q>uphill</q>
        side of the range.
        The other common source of regional snow are winter storms in mid-latitude temperate areas.
        These storms produce snow when cold,
        polar air masses meet warmer,
        wetter air masses in low-pressure areas.
        The warm moist air circulates
        (in the Northern Hemisphere)
        counter-clockwise over the cold air,
        cooling and producing snow.
        This was the cause of the massive snow shown in <xref ref="fig_jonas">Figure</xref>.
        During the height of the Northern Hemisphere winter,
        snow can cover up to 30% of the the continents,
        as shown by the gray areas in <xref ref="fig_seasonalsnow">Figure</xref>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The relationship between continued global warming and snow fall is complicated,
        both physically<fn>
        Kunkel, K. E., Robinson, D. A., Champion, S., Yin, X., Estilow, T., &amp; Frankson, R. M. (2016).
        Trends and extremes in northern hemisphere snow characteristics.
        Current Climate Change Reports, 2(2), 65-73.
        </fn> and politically.
        In low-latitude and low-lying areas,
        the limits of stable snowfall will move to higher latitudes and elevations.
        SO we expect snow covered areas to decrease over time.
        But, warmer air contains more water than colder air,
        about 6% more for each \SI{+1}{\kelvin} of warming.
        For places that are cold but currently dry<mdash/>such as the Great Plains of the United States and Canada<mdash/>for the short term global warming may bring
        <em>increased</em> snow.
        Even in aworld where climate is changing rapidly, weather still happens,
        and even places where snow is rare will still enjoy a making snowballs.
        This counter-intuitive result has repeatedly been at the center of political (snow) storms<fn>
        For example, Bump, P. (2015).
        Jim Inhofe's snowball has disproven climate change once and for all.

        but again reminds us of the difference between weather and its long term average, climate.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a climatic perspective, snow
        <em>is</em> getting less common.
        For example,
        since the early 1920s CE the average snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased<fn>
        AR5, Chapter 4, page 320,
        <q>Over the longer period, 1922-2012,
        data are available only for March and April,
        but these show a 7% [very likely, 4.5% to 9.5%] decline</q>
        </fn> by at least 7%, due to the the gradual increase in surface temperatures
        (<nbsp/>\SI{+1.1}{\kelvin}, or <m>2^{\circ}F</m>).
        <xref ref="fig_sce">Figure</xref>
        illustrates both sides of the change in snow.
        Areas in brown on the map recorded less snow in of the Another statistic makes just how fast snow cover is changing,
        particularly because of earlier springtime melting.
        The Northern Hemisphere snow season<mdash/>the length of time snow lays on the ground<mdash/>has declined by <em>20 days</em>
        since the winter of 1972-73 CE<fn>

        But about <m>2/3</m> of those rivers and lakes freeze up at least partially during the winter<fn>

        and the history of this freezing is a rich source of data on global climate change.
        With medium confidence, the IPCC concluded<fn>

        </fn> that the ice season in the Northern Hemisphere is getting shorter,
        at 30 to 40 days over the last century.
        As we saw with snow cover,
        the greatest reductions are during the Spring melt season,
        and reflect how the edge of the Cryosphere is rapidly eroding in our warming world.

    <title>Sea Ice</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        At noon on August 15, 1990,
        your author learned first-hand<mdash/>well,
        first foot<mdash/>about sea ice.
        He and two much smarter colleagues had set off that morning in a small inflatable raft to return to our base camp and the helicopter that would fly us from our study area in Northern Svalbard to the fascinating town of Langyerban.
        Our destination was just across the Wijdefjorden,
        and the day before had taken a few minutes of sun-filled fun.
        Overnight, winds had blown in sea ice,
        loose sheets of frozen sea water a few inches thick.
        In between the floes of ice were tiny little lanes of clear water,
        and we had been patiently and unsuccessfuly following one lead
        (pronounced <em>leed</em>)
        after the other to try and cover the last mile between us and our ride home.
        After an hour of mounting frustration we came to yet another dead end:
        the sea ice had closed up and we were surrounded by ice.
        Perhaps 10 or 20 feet away,
        another lead opened up into a clear patch of sea and an easy ride home.
        So I laid on the edge of the raft and tried pushing the thin floes out of our way.
        It worked, for a moment,
        until I lost hold of the raft and fell into the ice-cold water.
        Fortunately, I was wearing a full
        <q>immersion suit,</q>
        a bright-orange,
        rather cumbersome piece of gear that insulates the wearer from cold water.
        Bobbing in the water,
        we all laughed at my stupidity of falling overboard,
        and then I swam through a tiny crack in the ice,
        arms flailing windmill fashion,
        opening up a path for the boat.
        After dragging us to the other side of the floe,
        we made it to base in plenty of time for our ride home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sunlight fades pretty quickly as summer turns to autumn in Earth's polar regions.
        At the North Pole,
        the sun sets<mdash/>for six months<mdash/>on September 21.
        But over all the Arctic Ocean the nights become longer and colder as energy received from the Sun plummets<fn>
        NSIDC
        <url href="http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2017/09/arctic-sea-ice-at-minimum-extent-2/">Link</url>
        </fn> starting in mid-September.
        The air quickly cools below the sea surface temperature,
        and the ocean rapidly looses heat to the overlying atmosphere.
        Once the surface cools to about \SI{-1.5}{\celsius} (<m>30^{\circ}</m>F) ocean water begins to freeze in to <em>sea ice</em>
        (see <xref ref="fig_seaice_anncycle">Figure</xref>, upper panel),
        a mixture of water ice sprinkled with pockets of salty water,
        air bubbles, and even particles of salt.
        This newly-formed sea ice slowly thickens from the bottom,
        reaching \SIrange{1}{2}{\metre} thick over the long polar winter.
        The ice is blown and dragged around the Arctic Ocean, sometimes for years.
        Collisions between older ice floes thickens the ice,
        locally forming ice ridges \SIrange{10}{15}{\metre} thick.
        The resulting sea ice covers portions of the the Arctic Ocean year-round,
        providing habitats for seals,
        polar bears, and the occasional submarine
        (<xref ref="fig_sub_polar">Figure</xref>).
        Once spring arrives,
        increasing duration and intensity of sunlight melts some of the ice,
        and the cycle starts anew . Although the seasons are reversed,
        the same annual cycle of sea ice growth and decay also happens in the Southern Hemisphere
        (see <xref ref="fig_seaice_anncycle">Figure</xref>, lower panel),
        with an extensive belt of sea ice growing around Antarctica.
      </p>
      <p>
        The climatic effects of sea ice are profound,
        because it is a highly reflective but insulting lid.
        Sea ice has a much higher albedo than water,
        which keeps the poles cold
        (<xref ref="fig_cryo_albedo_feedback">Figure</xref>).
        But sea ice also insulates the relatively warm ocean from the frigid polar atmosphere,
        drastically slowing heat flow from the ocean to the atmosphere.
        This is an excellent example of how the Cryosphere slows heat flow within in the climate system.
        But because sea ice
        (and snow)
        are so thin,
        and their stability is so sensitive to temperature,
        they are unusually susceptible to tiny changes in heat flow and surface temperatures.

      <title>Arctic Amplification</title>
      <p>
        The entire Cryosphere,
        and particularly the seasonal parts in the Northern Hemisphere,
        are in the midst of rapid and worrisome changes.
        The Arctic is warming two to four times faster than the rest of the planet<fn>

        </fn>,
        a pattern called
        <em>Arctic Amplification</em>.
        One specific example of this is shown in <xref ref="fig_aa">Figure</xref>,
        which demonstrates that surface temperature changes at the North Pole are about 3 times those of the entire globe.
        Arctic Amplification is largely the consequence of feedbacks shown in <xref ref="fig_cryo_concept_map">Figure</xref>.
        Increasing surface temperatures in the Arctic attack sea ice in two ways.
        Warmer temperatures means ice doesn't grow as far south as it used to,
        so the average area covered by ice is deceasing by about 1% per year.
        Those higher air and ocean temperatures are also thinning the ice that's already there,
        reducing the most stable and thick part of the Arctic sea ice so strongly that its volume has decreased by 80% in one human generation<fn>

        (upper panel)
        shows the minimum annual extent of Arctic sea ice measured by satellite since 1979 CE. The minimum is clearly decreasing over time,
        even though year-to-year variations are significant.
        Most disturbing is that the loss is <em>accelerating</em>,
        due again to the feedbacks driving Arctic Amplification.
        The lower panel of <xref ref="fig_min_ice">Figure</xref>
        is a reasonable model for the future of Arctic sea ice,
        with the solid and dashed red lines showing best-estimate and 90% confidence interval for when the Arctic will be ice free in summer<fn>
        The Arctic ocean will be
        <q>effectively ice free</q>
        at <nbsp/><m>1 Mkm^2</m> of sea ice.
        This is a subtlety I believe worth skipping.
        </fn>.
        As of August of 2018 CE, with the minimum still a month away,
        the model predicts an even chance that summer-time Arctic sea ice will vanish by 2040 CE, when most readers of this book will still be paying off their college loans.
        There's a 5% chance of an ice-free Arctic Ocean by 2032 CE, just 14 years from the date of writing<fn>
        These dates are based entirely on the observed monthly average sea ice extents,
        and so are robust to small variation in daily extent data.
        I use a second order polynomial in the fitting,
        which is preferred over a linear model
        (based on AIC)
        with an odds ration of <nbsp/>32:1.

        is where that thickest and oldest ice once sat.
        Thinned by the unusually hot winter and summer of 2018 CE, the ice was broken up by winds and scattered.
        The dark ocean waters will absorb an extra dose of energy,
        likely delaying the growth of new sea ice.
        According to Walt Meier<fn>
        Watts, op cit.
        </fn>,
        a senior research scientist at the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, warming,
        melting and thinning have reached
        <q>even the coldest part of the Arctic with the thickest ice.
        So it's a pretty dramatic indication of the transformation of the Arctic sea ice and Arctic climate.</q>

      <p>
        The loss of Arctic sea ice and snow might seem a distant problem,
        one relegated to the far northern corner of the globe and too distant to affect the world at large.
        Unfortunately,
        all that missing sea ice and snow means more heating of the Arctic Ocean and the surrounding land.
        This heat eventually warms the Arctic atmosphere,
        changing atmospheric circulation and increasing the severity of both winter storms and summer heat waves across the Northern Hemisphere.
        While this connection is still controversial<fn>

        </fn> During the winter,
        the warmer Arctic atmosphere weakens the prevailing westerlies in the temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere.
        This allows frigid Polar air to sag southward,
        bringing cold temperatures and increased snowfall to Europe and North America.
        (This is an excellent example of how global warming can locally
        <em>increase</em> snow fall,
        here by juxtaposing cold, dry polar air with warmer, moister temperate air.)
      </p>
      <p>
        During the summer,
        the warmer Arctic atmosphere again alters the flow of the jet stream,
        allowing it to
        <q>lock</q>
        into a particularly wavy state.
        Areas south of the jet stream are bathed in relatively hot,
        humid air,
        which warms and dries the ground,
        creating devastating heat waves in those areas.
        Storms get weaker,
        and those storms tend gravitate toward the jet stream.
        This prevents rain from reaching the hot areas,
        plunging them into drought.
        The hot dry areas become even hotter and drier,
        which stabilizes the jet its loopy position.

        the Arctic is expected to warm by \SIrange{5}{10}{\celsius} (<m>9\ to \ 18^{\circ}F</m>) by the end of the century,
        likely leading to more frequent, hotter, wider-spread

    <title>Permafrost</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Permafrost is the groundwater of the cryosphere<mdash/>water-saturated soil which remains below freezing for at least a few years.
        In the Arctic, permafrost can be hundreds of meters
        (hundreds of yards)
        thick and older<fn>
        Froese, D. G., Westgate, J. A., Reyes, A. V., Enkin, R. J., &amp; Preece, S. J. (2008).
        Ancient Permafrost and a Future, Warmer Arctic.

        </fn> than 700,000 years.
        Don't just think ground under your foot!
        Permafrost includes sediments under the shallow oceans of continental shelves.
        These areas were land exposed to the atmosphere during ice age maxima (see <xref ref="ice_ages">section</xref>,
        but have since been flooded as ocean s swelled from melting ice sheets.
        The amount of ice in permafrost is actually quite small (see <xref ref="tab_wti">Table</xref>,
        but frozen ground covers an astonishing quarter of all land area in the Northern Hemisphere
        (<xref ref="fig_permafrost">Figure</xref>).
        On the top, permafrost is stable only as long as air temperatures remain below freezing, \SI{0}{\celsius}. In some areas
        (increasingly many, given Arctic Amplification),
        summertime temperatures melt the upper 1 m or so of soil,
        but the underlying ice stays frozen and impermeable to water.
        The melt water collects at the surface,
        forming the boggy, but gorgeous and vast tundra,
        the characteristic collection of plants and animals of the Arctic.
        Permafrost is also melted <em>from below</em>, by heat flow from Earth.
        Assaulted from both sides,
        permafrost is clearly in a precariously narrow zone of stability.

      <title>Permafrost Carbon Feedback</title>
      <p>
        As we saw in <xref ref="aa">Section</xref>,
        temperatures in the Arctic are rising rapidly and snow cover is decreasing,
        both of which drive more heat into soil.
        Just like Northern Hemisphere snow and sea ice,
        permafrost is melting, and at an accelerating rate<fn>
        AR5, Chap. 4.7.2
        </fn>.
        Local and regional effects of this melting are severe:
        tundra disappears, buildings can collapse (Figure 2.7),
        and extensive erosion are all common occurrences.
        And while these changes are devastating to those suffering through them,
        the large-scale threat of melting permafrost is carbon stored in that melting soil.
        That carbon is the remains of organisms<mdash/>largely plants<mdash/>which died 10 kya.
        Frozen soil in the Arctic stores about one and half times the carbon in the atmosphere<fn>
        Tarnocai, C., Canadell, J. G., Schuur, E. a.
        G., Kuhry, P., Mazhitova, G., &amp; Zimov, S. (2009).
        Soil organic carbon pools in the northern circumpolar permafrost region.

        <url href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2008GB003327">Link</url>
        </fn>,
        and this storage is threatened by permafrost melting.
        When cold and frozen the carbon isn't consumed by soil-dwelling organisms,
        but once thawed,
        the carbon is quickly utilized by organism and eventually expelled as carbon dioxide (<m>CO_2</m>) and methane (<m>CH_4</m>) into the atmosphere.
        These GHG increase temperatures and decrease snow cover,
        initiating a strong feedback that only accelerates the changes,
        as shown by the <em>Permafrost</em>
        pathway in <xref ref="fig_cryo_concept_map">Figure</xref>.
        Reasonable estimates<fn>

        </fn> suggest that by 2100 CE, the carbon released from thawing permafrost could increase average global warming by \SIrange{0.1}{0.5}{\kelvin}, a substantial amount on a global basis.

      <title>A bit of good news: clathrates</title>
      <p>
        By now, you might be reeling from the impacts of a warming cryosphere.
        So some good news:
        one potential source of GHGs frozen in the cryosphere is
        <em>not</em> in imminent danger.
        Clathrates are
        <q>cages</q>
        of water molecules wrapped around gas molecules,
        generally methane (<m>CH_4</m>),
        and are found where cold water and methane are squeezed together by the weight of overlying sediments and water.
        Together the water and methane form an icy-looking deposit,
        which has so much methane
        (they concentrate the gas by a factor of 200)
        that it's flammable,
        as shown in <xref ref="fig_clath_fire">Figure</xref>.
        Clathrates are stable only in the deepest portions of permafrost,
        those insulated from temperature changes at the surface by hundreds of meters of soil.
        Warming will take centuries to propagate to this depth,
        and thus the prodigious quantities of methane stored here won't soon reach the surface<fn>
