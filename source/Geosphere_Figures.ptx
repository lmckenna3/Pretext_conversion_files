    <caption>A small piece of the justifiably famous Allende meteorite. Early in the morning of Saturday February 8, 1969, a few tons of asteroid burrowed in to Earth's atmosphere. Seconds later, residents of Pueblito de Allende Mexico (630 km, 400 miles south of El Paso, TX) saw a bright, blue fireball move across the sky. Moments later the meteor exploded, spewing thousands of fragments (like the one shown) across northern Mexico. The Allende meteorite records pieces of the earliest Solar System including chondrules (the dark spherical blobs, formed from melted dust), calcium-aluminum inclusions (the white hunks, formed from gasses condensing to solids) and a dark fine-grained matrix rich in carbon and water. The calcium aluminum inclusions are the oldest known things in the Solar System: they formed \SI{4567.3(2)}{\giga\year} ago (Connelly, J. N. et al., (2012). The absolute chronology and thermal processing of solids in the solar protoplanetary disk. Science, 338(6107), 651-655.). This is the stuff from which Earth, and hence you and me, are made. This photograph was digitally enhanced by stretching the brightness and contrast to reveal the meteorite's texture, the scale is in centimeters.</caption>

    <caption>A perspective view of the Solar System viewed from the location of the most distant man-made object (Pioneer 11), generated by the wonderful NASA/JPL-Caltech Solar System Simulator (http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/). The upper panel focuses on the outer planets, and the most famous non-planet, Pluto. Pluto's odd orbit stands out, illustrating that it deserved its sad demotion to
    <q>dwarf planet</q>. The lower panel focuses on the inner planets (labeled) and two of the larger bodies in the Asteroid Belt (in gray). Even at this scale the planar nature, and profound scale, of the Solar System is evident. Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech.</caption>

    <caption>A schematic view of the Solar System. Panel A (upper left) shows the planet's orbit as viewed from the
    <q>side</q>
    of the Solar System. All of the planets orbit within \ang{7} of a plane, indicating that the planets originally formed in a plane as well. Panel B (middle left) shows the system from above. Planets orbit the Sun in elliptical, not circular, orbits. This is particularly easy to see in the orbits of Mercury and Mars shown in the magnified illustration of Panel C (lower left). The Edgeworth Kuiper Belt is too distant from the Sun to show in its entirety on the diagram, so its location is indicated by the small portion in the upper right. The \:O\:{o}rt cloud would lie more than 600 feet from the page at the scale of the diagram, and the closest star to Earth would be about 3000 ft away! Space is big. The actual size of the planets can't be shown in either parts of Panel B, instead they are shown magnified by about 400 times in Panel D (right). Earth is about 1/10 the size of Jupiter, which in turn is about 1/10 the size of the Sun.</caption>

    <caption>The relative scale of objects in the Solar System. Ceres is the largest object in the Asteroid Belt, discovered from Earth on January 1, 1801 CE. The object was hailed as a missing planet until the second (and third, then fourth...) asteroid was discovered a few years later. The Moon is about one quarter of Earth's size, and is one of the larger natural satellites in the Solar System. Earth is the largest of the Terrestrial planets, but is tiny compared to the largest of the Gas/Ice Giants, Jupiter. Courtesy NASA.</caption>

    <caption>Ceres' heavily cratered surface (particularly obvious at the terminator on the left) shows the violent way it accreted boulders and smaller planetesimals during its formation in the early Solar System. With a diameter of roughly \SI{940}{\kilo\metre} (550 miles), Ceres is differentiated into a rocky core and a water-rock crust (seen in the photograph). Ceres is obviously round, because its gravity is stronger, over the long term, than the material of which it is made. Thousands of objects the size, but not the composition, of Ceres would be needed to form Earth. Tens of thousands of these objects roamed the inner Solar System 4.56 Gya.

Vesta is the second largest Main Belt Asteroid (after Ceres), about \SI{530}{\kilo\metre} (330 miles) across. Note that some asteroids, like 243 Ida, have their own moons! The heavily cratered surfaces are witness to billions of years of punishing exposure to a hostile space environment. Image courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech/JAXA/ESA.</caption>

    <caption>The birth of stars and planets, revealed in this magnificent photograph from the Hubble Space Telescope of a region in the constellation Carnia, 7500 light years away. The area in the image is about 3 light years across. The striking red-brown columns are
    <q>clouds</q>
    of gas and dust; the wispy whitish-blue tendrils are the same gas and dust after being evaporated by the intense light of the new stars (pinkish, with artefactual crosses). The dense globules are the sites of ongoing star and planet formation. The twin jets are material being shot from the forming stars. Our Solar System formed in the same way, with dozens of stars forming simultaneously in a region just a few light years across. Credit: NASA, ESA, and M. Livio and the Hubble 20th Anniversary Team (STScI, https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1007e/).</caption>

    <caption>This striking Hubble Space Telescope photograph reveals a proto-planetary disk in the Orion Nebula, 1500 light years away. We see the disk from nearly edge on, so the central star is blocked from view; the white spots above and (more faintly) below the bow-tie-shaped disk are reflections of star light from the disk itself. Our Solar System formed in a similar (though much smaller) disk 4.56 Ga. Compare this actual disk with the cross-sectional view in <xref ref="fig_ppdisk2">Figure</xref>.

  <figure xml:id="fig_ppdisk2" >
    <caption>A sketch of the proto-planetary nebula in which our Solar System formed. The dense central plane of the disk is the formation area of boulders, planetesimals, embryos and finally planets. Inside the <em>snow line</em> (red shading) temperatures were sufficiently hot to melt and evaporate ices and gasses, leaving predominantly dust in the central plane. The snow line initially formed about three times further from the Sun than Earth is now. The dense central plane extended out to about 30 times the Earth-Sun distance. Based on Nuth, J. A. (2001).

  <figure xml:id="fig_jakob1" >
    <caption>The formation of Earth. The first solid stuff in our Solar System were tiny Calcium-Aluminum Inclusions, or CAIs. They formed from the gas and dust in the proto-planetary nebula at \SI{4567.3(2)} Ma. Heating from collisions and decay of radioactive isotopes in the grains led to the melting and differentiation of many planetesimals, leaving them with dense metallic cores surrounded by rocky mantles and a thin crust of volcanic rocks and ices. Within 100,000 years, the first embryos of the terrestrial planets had formed. Some embryos grew more rapidly than others, and within 10 million years, <m>\sim 64%</m> of Earth had accreted into the embryo destined to become home. By that time, proto-Earth must have been the dominant planet at 1 astronomical unit (the distance between Earth and the Sun), sweeping in or ejecting the remaining material near our orbit. Accretion was effectively complete \SI{40}{100} million years after CAIs formed, when the collision of Earth with a Mars-sized impactor led to the formation of the Moon. The figure is not to scale.

  <figure xml:id="fig_ironmets" >
    <caption>Two metallic meteorites from the Kristin Chon Collection at Framingham State University. They look non-descript, masquerading as slag or the other industrial by product. Cut one open (on the right) and you can see that they are entirely Fe-Ni metal. The characteristic Widmanst"atten pattern [admittedly poorly developed here; I need to polish the surface and hit it with HNO3] seen on the polished face indicates extraordinarily slow cooling of the once molten Fe-Ni core of the meteorite's parent body. Most estimate suggest the core crystallized over 10 Myr time scale. These meteorites demonstrate the existence of differentiated planetesimals in the early Solar System, the slow cooling of the core in a large objects, and the later disruption of the parent body by an impact that scattered pieces into Earth's orbit. This photograph was digitally enhanced by stretching the brightness and contrast to reveal the meteorite's texture.</caption>

  <figure xml:id="fig_pallasite" >
    <caption>A thin slice of a pallasite meteorite. The green crystals are olivine, an iron- and magnesium-rich mineral and the principal component of the upper mantle of rocky objects like including Earth. The shiny gray material is solidified metal, largely iron and nickel. The texture of the meteorite indicates the olivine crystal were floating in the molten Fe-Ni metal. How the olivines and metals were mixed is somewhat of a mystery, but current hypotheses have the olivines and liquid metal mixing after a collision that shattered an already differentiated object.</caption>

    <caption>Inferring Earth's composition from its bulk density. Earth-massed planets made of various proportion of metallic iron and silicate rock (given by the lower row on the figure) would have the density given in the upper row. Earth's measured density is approximately \SI{5515}{\kilogram\per\metre\cubed}, suggesting Earth is about 32% metal. The estimate is about 2% points too high, quite an achievement considering that the estimate is based on a single observable property of the planet: its density. In the past decade, astronomers have determined the radius and the mass of almost 850 planets (precisely 843 as of 23 June 2019, according to
    <url href="http://exoplanet.eu/">The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia</url>
    ) orbiting stars thousands of light years from Earth. Using the resulting density, this method can be used to estimate their bulk compositions!</caption>

  <figure xml:id="fig_seismic" >
    <caption>The power of seismology lies in revealing Earth's deep structure, much as a CAT scan reveals the internal organs of a patient. Here rocks that are colder (in blue) and warmer (in red) than usual reveal an enormous cold plate lying \SIrange{400}{1200}{\kilo\metre} below the surface of North America. The map view in the upper panels shows the ancient Farallon Plate (in blue) lying \SI{700}{\kilo\metre} below North America. In the lower panel a cross section of the Earth (along the line indicated in the upper panel) shows the Farallon plate (in blue, labeled ''EF'') trundling eastward, toward the viewer. This cold slab, once a great tectonic plate at the surface, has traveled from the west coast of the continent over the past 150 My. (Porritt, R. W., Allen, R. M., &amp; Pollitz, F. F. (2014).

The volcanic rock started as a magma<mdash/>molten rock<mdash/>in Earth's mantle. During its ascent through the mantle to the surface, the magma tore off a chunk of the mantle and carried it to the surface. The abundant green mineral is olivine (seen also in <xref ref="fig_pallasite">Figure</xref>), the less common black mineral is pyroxene. Not visible is a third common mantle mineral, garnet. We don't have to guess the composition of the mantle, we can measure it! This photograph was digitally enhanced by stretching the brightness and contrast to reveal the sample's texture.</caption>

Smooth, continuous changes in the density or seismic wave velocity indicate volumes in Earth with homogenous chemical compositions and mineral makeup. Discrete jumps (for example at 2890 km depth) reflect abrupt changes in one or both. Note that S-wave velocities fall to \SI{0}{\kilo\metre\per\second} in the outer core, indicating that this part of Earth is liquid. S-wave velocities return to positive values in the inner core, indicating it is solid.</caption>
