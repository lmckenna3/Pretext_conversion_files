  <title>Water and the Hydrosphere</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Studying the
      <q>Hydrosphere</q>
      should be easy: examine the watery part of Earth.
      But just about every part of Earth <em>is</em> watery
      (see <xref ref="fig_where_water">Figure</xref>),
      and the parts that are most watery aren't even all water!
      The difficulty arises from water's wonderful chemical flexibility,
      partially due to, of course, hydrogen bonding.
      So let's be explicit: <em>for our purposes,
      the Hydrosphere includes all those parts of the Earth that are bodies of connected liquid water</em>.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Where's the Water?</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        With this definition, the Hydrosphere includes oceans;
        lakes and other bodies of water standing on the surface;
        rivers and streams flowing across the surface; and even
        <q>groundwater,</q>
        liquid water flowing through the Geosphere.
        While this definition may seem arbitrary,
        we'll see that water's behavior varies depending upon its pressure and temperature.
        So our definition of the Hydrosphere excludes solid water in the Cryosphere
        (where water behaves like a rock),
        water vapor in the Atmosphere,
        water in the Biosphere, and the
        <q>supercritical</q>
        water in Earth's Geosphere
        (where water and rock dissolve in to each other).
        The amount of water in the deep parts of the Geosphere<mdash/>the mantle in particular<mdash/>is highly uncertain<fn>
        Fei, H., Yamazaki, D., Sakurai, M., Miyajima, N., Ohfuji, H., Katsura, T., &amp; Yamamoto, T. (2017).
        A nearly water-saturated mantle transition zone inferred from mineral viscosity.
        Science Advances, 3(6), e1603024.
        </fn>,
        but probably includes at least as much water as found today in the oceans,
        and perhaps twice as much!
      </p>
      <p>
        With our definition, the Hydrosphere is essentially just the Oceans,
        which contain 96.5% of all water in the Hydrosphere (See <xref ref="tab_hydro_comps">Table</xref>
        and <xref ref="fig_water_scales">Figure</xref>).
        We'll discuss the oceans in detail below.
        The small portion of the Hydrosphere left over is mostly groundwater,
        followed by water in lakes, and then rivers and streams.
        Each deserves a brief discussion of their own.

      <title>Groundwater</title>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Formation and location</title>
        <p>
          Next time you have the opportunity,
          watch rain falling on a hillside.
          After it hits the ground,
          the water can sink in to the soil, flow along the surface,
          get absorbed by plants, or evaporate back into the Atmosphere.
          The details of this will be part of our discussion of the hydrologic cycle,
          which we'll cover in Chapter 9,
          <em>Earth's Respiration</em>.
          For now, follow the water sinking into the soil,
          which passes through the air-filled voids between soil grains.
          Eventually the sinking water reaches a place where the void spaces are completely filled with water,
          which defines the <em>water table</em>,
          the upper surface of groundwater.
          Don't think of groundwater as filling underground cavities;
          instead, think of a glass filled with ice and water (See <xref ref="fig_ice_soil">Figure</xref>).
          The ice represents the particles of soil,
          and the water in between the ice represents groundwater.
          The water flows between the connected pathways around the ice
          (which anyone who has used a straw to drink a beverage can attest to),
          but the volume of water relative to ice is small.
          So too in groundwater,
          where water typically takes up 10% of the total volume of rock and water<fn>
          Gleeson, T., Befus, K. M., Jasechko, S., Luijendijk, E., &amp; Cardenas, M. B. (2015).
          The global volume and distribution of modern groundwater.

          <url href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2590">Link</url>
          </fn>.
          Despite making up a small portion of the total volume of rock under your feet,
          the total volume of groundwater stored in underground aquifers is surprising:
          extracted just from the first \SI{2}[{\kilo}{\metre}] (1.3 miles) of Earth,
          groundwater would make a \SI{180}{\metre} (600 foot) layer of water across the continents.
          All that water,
          buried beneath Earth's solid and opaque surface, is easy to miss.
        </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <p>
        Which is surprising,
        as the average depth of the water table is only \SI{1}{\metre}<fn>

        Global Patterns of Groundwater Table Depth.

        <url href="https://doi.org/DOI: 10.1126/science.1229881">Link</url>
        </fn>.
        After water percolates through the unsaturated soil to the water table,
        it can flow like any other body of water,
        as shown by the blue arrows in <xref ref="fig_gw_sketch">Figure</xref>.
        Streams, rivers and lakes form where the water table intersects Earth's surface;
        wetlands form where the water table is just below the surface.
        Although most groundwater is deeply buried,
        surface waters that you see
        (and use)
        every day are intimately connected to and dependent upon groundwater for their long-term stability<fn>

      </p>
      <p>
        Groundwater is a long-term stabilizer because water can remain in aquifers for thousands of years<fn>
        Fan, Y. (2015).
        Groundwater: How much and how old?

        <url href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2609">Link</url>
        </fn> after falling as rain.
        As you might guess, deeper
        (greater than <m>\SI{1000}{\metre}</m> [3300 feet])
        groundwater tends to be older than shallower groundwater,
        as shown in <xref ref="fig_gw_sketch">Figure</xref>.
        This old groundwater can travel substantial distances over all that time,
        and pick up high concentrations of compounds in the rocks through which it flows.
        Because of this,
        older groundwater tends to be more saline<mdash/>contain more dissolved salts<mdash/>than shallower and younger groundwater.
        Just the existence of old groundwater shows that deep aquifers recharge slowly,
        in some cases over thousands of years.
        Groundwater, while vast, is finite.

        <title>Groundwater as a Common Property Resource</title>
        <p>
          Fresh water is a crucial and irreplaceable resource to human society.
          Not just for drinking and bathing,
          but even more so for growing food.
          About 90% of all water used by humans is for irrigating crops,
          of which nearly half comes from groundwater<fn>
          Morris B.L., et al. (2003) Groundwater and Its Susceptibility to Degradation: A Global Assessment of the Problem and Options for Management (United Nations Environ Programme, Nairobi)
          </fn> In the U.S., groundwater provides the vast majority of water used for growing food in the Midwest (
          <q>America's breadbasket</q>
          ) and in California's Central Valley (
          <q>America's fruit and vegetable basket</q>).
          Both of these highly productive farming areas ($60 billion worth of food annually) are arid and receive far too little rain to fuel their spectacular productivity.
          Instead, farmers pump groundwater from the High Plains and Central Valley aquifers to irrigate their crops.
          Farmers in other arid climates must do the same.
          In most places,
          anyone who can afford to drill a well into the aquifer can use the finite resource of groundwater,
          and not surprisingly and the world aquifers are facing the Tragedy of the Common<fn>

        The High Plains aquifer provides an excellent example of groundwater as a common property resource.
        The aquifer stretches \SI{1300}[{\kilo}{\metre}] (800 miles) from South Dakota to central Texas,
        with the water table less than a few hundred feet deep (See <xref ref="fig_hpa">Figure</xref>),
        left panel).
        Between 1950 CE
        (roughly when pumping started),
        to 2018 CE about 10% of all the groundwater in the aquifer had been pumped out by farmers and other users
        (see <xref ref="fig_hpa">Figure</xref>),
        right panel),
        although areas in Kansas and Texas have pumped more than 50% of the available water<fn>

        <url href="http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usgspubs/17">Link</url>
        </fn>.
        Since 1950 CE, the water table has dropped about \SI{4}{\metre} (13 feet),
        and continues to drop at about \SI{8}[{\centi}{\metre}] (3 inches) every year<fn>

        </fn>.
        All these numbers merely demonstrate that the High Plains Aquifer is being overused,
        and because it is finite it will eventually run out of water.
        That won't be for 150-200 years on average,
        but might be as soon as 60 years for parts of Kansas and Texas.

        As we noted in Chapter 2, the time scale of this collective action problem (200 years!) seems so very long that we tend to discount the need to act quickly to avoid a problem only our far removed descendants will live to face.
        But long-time residents of the western Kansas acknowledge that the climate is changing,
        and water is more scarce than it was 50 years ago.
        The small town of Atwood used to have two ground-water fed lakes,
        providing places for skating in the winter and boating in the summer.
        Despite multiple technological fixes,
        including lining the bottom of the lakes with an impermeable layer and combing the water from two lakes in to one,
        the lakes are now smaller than x% of their old size.

      <title>Surface water: Rivers, wetlands and lakes</title>
      <p>
        Measured just be the volume of water they contain, rivers,
        wetlands and lakes (what we'll call <em>surface water</em>
        may not seem important enough to deserve even a paragraph.
        Not so!
        They play a profound, if subtle,
        role in moving water from land back to the oceans.
        Rainfall on the continents is a fundamental part of the weathering process,
        with implications for the composition of the oceans,
        and the long-term stability of climate.
      </p>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Rivers</title>
        <p>
          Rain which falls on the continents but doesn't evaporate or become groundwater drains runs off from the continents back to the oceans in rivers and streams.
          While this may seem obvious to us,
          the idea was not scientifically established until the mid <m>18^{th}</m> Century.
          Besides water,
          rivers and streams carry with them materials eroded and dissolved from the continents.
          The eroded material is rapidly dumped from rivers once they reach the sea,
          forming vast deltas,
          such as seen at the mouths of the Mississippi, Haung Bo (Yellow) and Ganges rivers
          (<xref ref="deltas">Figure</xref>). \paragraphs{Weathering and dissolved materials} Surface water also carries significant material dissolved from the continents,
          ultimately derived from weathering of rocks exposed at or near Earth's surface.
          Water<mdash/>in droplets in clouds or lying on rocks at the surface<mdash/>is in equilibrium with the atmosphere,
          and so the drops also contain dissolved gasses,
          most importantly <m>CO_2</m>.
          Water and carbon dioxide react weakly with each other to form naturally occurring carbonic acid (See <xref ref="eq_carbonic">Reaction</xref>).
          The carbonic acid itself breaks down to form ions<mdash/>electrically charged molecular fragments<mdash/>dissolved in the water,
          including a very reactive hydrogen ion.
          So even the purest rain water is,
          fortunately, slightly acidic.
          (Don't confuse this natural acidity with
          <q>acid rain,</q>
          which is due to strong acids formed in rain from gasses emitted by coal burning.)
          With its slight acidity, water attacks rocks at Earth's surface,
          breaking bonds both between and within minerals in the rock.

        For our purposes,

        Weathering via the Urey reaction happens faster in warmer,
        wetter climates,
        and in areas undergoing active uplift,
        such as mountain belts<fn>

        Hydrologic regulation of chemical weathering and the geologic carbon cycle.
        Science, 343(6178), 1502-1504.
        </fn>.
        Interestingly, mountain belts tend to induce rainfall,
        and thus contribute to their own weathering,
        erosion and ultimate destruction<fn>

        </fn>.
        The Urey reaction drives the mixing of geosphere,
        hydrosphere and atmosphere,
        and rivers ultimately transport the results of this mixing into the oceans.
        Once there all three products of the Urey reaction are used by marine organism to build shells,
        shells which eventually collect as sediment on the ocean floor.
        These sediments store vast quantities of carbon that otherwise would collect in the atmosphere as <m>CO_2</m>.
        As we'll discover in Chapter 10,
        this process is a key part of the carbon cycle,
        and has moderated Earth's climate for billions of years.
