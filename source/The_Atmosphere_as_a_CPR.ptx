  <title>The Atmosphere as a Common Pool Resource</title>

    <p>
      But the desire to dilute effluent into the wastelands means that eventually they spread world-wide,
      like the smog from Chinese factories or the carbon dioxide from cars in the United States.
      The ability of the hydrosphere and atmosphere to hold this waste is yet another resource provided by Earth to human society.
      But this resource is different than most:
      this resource is freely available to anyone,
      often without direct cost.
      You can test this yourself: light a camp fire or offer to wash a friend's car.
      Chances are,
      no one will ask you for a license to add waste to the atmosphere or hydrosphere.
      Sure, outdoor fires may be banned by your local municipality,
      but <em>not</em> because of the waste gasses.
      They are afraid of the open fire.
      If you live in an area of drought,
      you may not be allowed to use public water to wash that car,
      but letting the rinse water seep into the local stream is most likely <em>not</em> unlawful.
      We all, it seems, use these spheres in common.

    <title>Common Pool Resources</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The atmosphere's ability to act as a wasteland is an example of a
        <em>common property resource</em>.
        You are most likely familiar with private ownership of resources:
        you own your phone, perhaps a car,
        maybe even a house or some land.
        You may also belong to an organization or club that provides resources to members only:
        gyms are a typical example.
        Finally, many resources are owned by the public,
        typically through some form of government.
        The United States government owns not only a splendid variety of National Parks,
        but also 27% of all land in the US<fn>
        Vincent, Carol Hardy, Laura A. Hanson, Jerome P. Bjelopera (2014)
        <em>Federal Land Ownership: Overview and Data</em>
        Congressional Research Service 7-5700, R42346,

        accessed 06 March 2017
        </fn>.
        All these things are resources, but the question of who
        <q>owns</q>
        them is less clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the Anthroposphere relies on thousands of different resources,
        most can be neatly and naturally divided by two complimentary characteristics (See <xref ref="tab_goods">Table</xref>).
        The first is <em>excludability</em>.
        Clubs and private concerns can exclude
        <q>others</q>
        from access to their resources.
        Common property and public resources are not easily excludeable<mdash/>just about anyone can use them, freely.
        The other quality is the resource's <em>extent</em>.
        Some resources are <em>non-finite</em>.
        This class includes equipment in the gym (sure,
        there may be a line to use a machine,
        but the machine's usefulness isn't
        <em>destroyed</em> by others' use),
        and some resources held by the public, such as park land.
        But for us, it is the many resources which are
        <em>finite</em> that interest us.
        That resources are finite is obvious when applied to your dinner,
        but perhaps less obvious when applied to resources in the hinterlands,
        such as coal or gold ore,
        or wastelands, such as the ability of a dump to hold wastes.

      <title>Definition</title>
      <p>
        Common property resources are by definition finite and freely available for use.
        Finite in this sense means that their use is a
        <q>zero-sum</q>
        game: if you use some, there is less for me to use.
        Consider fish.
        Only a finite number of fish are available for taking at a given time,
        and if you extract a few thousand pounds from the ocean,
        there are fewer fish for me to take.
        Excluding others from taking common property resources is difficult<mdash/>because of law,
        tradition,
        or nature of the resources.
        Fish for example can migrate across state and national boundaries,
        making them open to all.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Examples</title>
      <p>
        CPRs are surprisingly
        (pardon the pun)
        common.
        As hinted above,
        fish are an excellent example of a common property resource.
        The European settlement of the New England region was driven by the spectacular abundance of fish in New England waters.
        At the time of the American Revolution,
        fish was the largest source of revenue to New England,
        and hence the war effort<fn>
        Magra, C. P. (2007).
        The New England cod fishing industry and maritime dimensions of the American Revolution.
        Enterprise &amp; Society, 8(4), 799-806.
        </fn>,
        and to this day a
        <q>sacred cod</q>
        hangs in the Massachusetts state legislature as a reminder of the role cod fishing once played in the Commonwealth.
        As <xref ref="fig_cod_lobstah">Figure</xref> illustrates,
        a combination of over-fishing,
        climate change and bad policy decisions<fn>
        Pershing, A. J., Alexander, M. A., Hernandez, C. M., Kerr, L. A., Le Bris, A., Mills, K. E., ... &amp; Sherwood, G. D. (2015).
        Slow adaptation in the face of rapid warming leads to collapse of the Gulf of Maine cod fishery.

        Fishing failure and success in the Gulf of Maine:
        lobster and groundfish management.
        Maritime Studies, 13(1), 8
        </fn> led to the utter collapse of the cod population in 1990s.
        The lobster fishery is still going strong.
        As we'll see below,
        the different fates of these resources has much to do with how fishers choose to act towards others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other common property resources can be found closer to home.
        Trash barrels in a park fit the definition:
        freely available for use, but of finite capacity
        (<xref ref="fig_trash">Figure</xref>).
        Trash barrels are clearly the entry point of tash into a literal
        <q>wasteland</q>
        for solid wastes.
        Eventually the barrels will be emptied and the trash transferred to an incinerator or landfill.
        Either way, the remnants of that trash will remain in the atmosphere or geosphere for 100s of years,
        as natural recycling(<xref ref="fig_circ_flow">Figure</xref>
        of such materials is dreadfully slow.
        Eventually even the largest dump,
        landfill or wasteland eventually fills up.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Application to Climate</title>
      <p>
        Like a trash barrel,
        our atmosphere's ability to hold waste products is limited.
        Not by size,
        but because of how the very wastes we emit into the atmosphere are changing Earth's climate.
        Three fundamental actions at the very core of human culture<mdash/>the burning of fossil fuels,
        land use change,
        and manufacuring if cement<mdash/> all release waste <m>CO_{2}</m> gas into the atmosphere.
        In an irony known before the start of the <m>20^{th}</m> Century,
        <m>CO_{2}</m> is a potent greenhouse gas.
        Every kilogram we emit will eventually make Earth's climate warmer.
        The ability of the Atmosphere to absorb our waste <m>CO_{2}</m> without changing Earth's climate is finite.
        Every kilogram of <m>CO_{2}</m> you emit is one less kilogram I can emit without consuming the wasteland's resourcefulness.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the atmosphere has been, and still is,
        a freely available wasteland for <m>CO_{2}</m> and other GHG wastes.
        There are few direct costs
        (as of now)
        for emitting <m>CO_{2}</m> into the atmosphere.
        So we are left with in inescapable conclusion:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The ability of the Atmosphere to absorb the waste greenhouse gasses of human activities without changing Earth's climate is a common property resource.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        As a shorthand, we'll refer to this as the
        <q>atmospheric CPR.</q>
        We've already seen that some common property resources,
        like cod from Maine, can be destroyed in years,
        while some, like lobster, can be well-managed for decades.
        A number of questions may occur to you immediately: Is collapse of a common property resource inevitable?
        Is there scientific research that provides insight into why some CPRs are well managed
        (like lobster)
        and some (cod) not?
        And finally,
        is there any evidence that humans are inclined to manage CPRs effectively?
        And perhaps most importantly,
        which path will the atmosphere, and climate, follow?

    <title>The Tragedy of the Common: What do you choose to maximize</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        CPRs are fragile because their fate is precariously balanced between their finite size and infinite availability.
        An added complexity is that CPRs are used by humans,
        humans who can make irrational decisions when they feel their best interests are at stake,
        as we saw in the Prisoner's Dilemma above.
        And most importantly,
        some problems raised by CPRs don't have a technological solution,
        so we can't
        <q>science the heck</q>

      <title>Hardin and the Tragedy of the Common</title>
      <p>
        These various threads surrounding CPRs were brought to public attention in a famous,
        controversial,
        quirky and brilliant paper written by ecologist Garrett Hardin over 50 years ago.
        In <em>The Tragedy of the Commons<fn>
        Hardin, G. (1968).
        The Tragedy of the Commons.
        Science, 162(3859), 1243. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.162.3859.1243
        </fn></em> Hardin noted that CPRs are often driven to extinction in a process he famously called the
        <em>Tragedy of the Commons</em>.
        Because the CPR is freely available yet not owned by any individual, Hardin thought it was rational for users to extract as much from the resources as they could,
        as fast as they could, before someone else consumed the resource.
        The short-term rational self-interests of the users leads to destruction of the resource for all.
        This is the collective action dilemma:
        choice that may be good and rational for an individual user may be bad and catastrophic for a group of users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hardin used a simple but brilliant example of this problem.
        Many old villages in New England have a
        <em>common</em>, (no 's') a publicly-owned, shared area.
        All landowners were allowed to graze cattle on the common,
        at no direct cost.
        Consider a single farmer:
        he has every reason to put as many cattle as he can on the common,
        where they can eat all the grass they want for free.
        Of course, all farmers in town have the same idea,
        and load their cattle on to the Common.
        Soon, the grass
        (the common resource)
        is completely consumed.
        James Acheson and Ray Gardner put the case succinctly when they wrote<fn>
        Acheson, J., &amp; Gardner, R. (2014).
        Fishing failure and success in the Gulf of Maine:
        lobster and groundfish management.
        Maritime Studies, 13(1), 8. https://doi.org/10.1186/2212-9790-13-8
        </fn>
        <q>In a collective action dilemma,
        rational action by individuals brings disaster</q>
        to societies.
      </p>
      <p>
        After describing this result, Hardin correctly noted that collective action problems often
        <q>have no technical solutions.</q>
        Individuals and societies can't science their way out of a collective action problem.
        They need to change social preferences,
        the way people, groups and societies act toward each other.
        Hardin thought the very first action societies had to take was choosing what facet of the resource to maximize.
        Options might include short-term production, long-term sustainability,
        profitability, resource health,
        or a host of other properties.
        The problem is that only one facet can be maximized at a time.
        Hardin was so pessimistic about his fellow humans that he thought the Tragedy of the Commons was inevitable unless resources were owned by private concerns or governments.
        He was, fortunately, wrong about <em>that</em>.

    <title>The Tragedy of the Commons isn't inevitable</title>
    <p>
      You can see for yourself
      (the lobster fishery in <xref ref="fig_cod_lobstah">Figure</xref>)
      that some CPRs avoid self-destruction just fine, thank you.
      Other famous examples can be found from local irrigation cooperatives in Tibet to wildlife sanctuaries in India to the atmosphere's ozone layer (see Chapter 6)<fn>

      </fn>.
      CPRs which have self-destructed are all too common.
      The cod fishery is one example,
      as are irrigation projects in California and,
      recently , the atmospheric CPR. Most people have lived through the collapse of the New England cod fishery without even knowing it,
      and the difficulties with California's irrigation system directly affects you only through the price of food.
      But self-destruction of the atmospheric CPR will inevitable lead to global climate change,
      and the planet-wide consequences discussed in <xref ref="Risk">Section</xref>.
