    <p>
      Like every part of the Earth,
      the contemporary hydrosphere with which we have such first-hand experience is <em>not</em>
      the same as the hydrosphere of the past.
      The oceans in particular have evolved in synchrony with the atmosphere. biosphere and geosphere,
      changes in each driving changes in the others.
      Our approach in this section of the book is to look at each of the spheres in turn,
      examining the connections<mdash/>the flows of energy and mass<mdash/>between them and how these interactions formed a continuously-habitable climate on Earth.
      A study more focused on the sequential history of Earth and Earth systems (a field known as Historical Geology) would instead use time as the organizational tool,
      and examine the happenings in all spheres at each slice of Earth's history.
      Both approaches are valuable,
      but our approach has the advantage of explicitly examining the powerful effects of feedbacks between the spheres on shaping climate.
      The feedbacks involving the oceans, atmosphere and biosphere,
      show how Earth naturally has stable climate states,
      states that can change over time.

    <title>Origins of Earth's water</title>
    <p>
      Before we tackle the hydropshere's long-term evolution,
      we need to understand the source of Earth's water, both in time and space.
      The timing and location of Jupiter's formation was the key factor delivering water to the still-forming Earth.
      As we saw in Chapter 5, Earth and the other terrestrial planets formed in the warm inner portion of the proto-planetary nebula.
      Inside the
      <q>snow-line</q>
      gas and ice were largely absent,
      and the growing planetesimals were bone dry.
      The terrestrial planets thus formed hot and dry.
      Beyond the snow-line,
      at distances beyond 3 to 4 AU from the Sun, water ice was stable,
      and made up significant proportions of growing planetesimals<fn>

      Origin of water in the inner Solar System: Planetesimals scattered inward during Jupiter and Saturn's rapid gas accretion.
      Icarus, 297, 134-148.
      </fn>.
      The logical conclusion is that Earth's water is from the outer solar system!
      Fortunately we can test this hypothesis,
      and even add some precision to the location.
      The contemporary asteroid belt still contains remnants of planetesimals formed near Earth
      (the s-type asteroids)
      and those formed beyond the snow-line (The c-type asteroids).
      We have samples of both types thanks to meteorites,
      so we can minutely study their chemical and isotopic composition.
      Studying the water alone isn't enough to uniquely identify the source of Earth's water.
      Both hydrogen and nitrogen have multiple isotopes,
      and their ratios provide isotopic
      <q>fingerprints</q>
      unique to the many possible sources of water to Earth.
      <xref ref="fig_N_h_isotopes">Figure</xref>
      shows that objects farther from the Sun (comets,
      some of the asteroids sampled by meteorites) are isotopically distinct from Earth:
      these distant objects couldn't have contributed any substantial water to the early Earth<fn>

      Nature Communications, Nature Publishing Group, 2016, 7, pp.11684. 10.1038/ncomms11684.
      </fn>.
      The best isotopic match is with primitive carbon- and water-rich carbonaceous chondrites,
      whose parent bodies formed beyond the orbit of Jupiter.
      Go ahead, have a sip of water,
      and enjoy the taste of the solar system.

    <p>
      Those asteroids must have flooded the inner solar system very early in its history (<xref ref="fig_water_timing">Figure</xref>; see this
      <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji5ZC7CP5to">this link</url>
      for a great video of the process,
      as all of the terrestrial planets for which we have data share Earth's H and N isotopic composition.
      The cause of this
      <q>flood</q>
      was the rapid formation of Jupiter and Saturn in the earliest phases of the solar system's formation
      (<xref ref="fig_jupiter_source_water">Figure</xref>).

      During this early period, Jupiter and Saturn carved rings of dust and gas from the proto-planetary nebula as they grew.
      As their mass increased,
      their gravitational muscle nudged the orbits of nearby c-type asteroids,
      sending some into the asteroid belt
      (where they still reside)
      and some into the inner solar system.
      All of this activity is loosely constrained to within the first 8-20 My after solar system formation started.

    <title>The earliest oceans</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        But not for long.
        As we saw in Chapter 6, Earth's formation ended with a giant collision that left the upper few hundred kilometers of the Earth molten,
        covered with a magma ocean.
        Don't confuse this magma ocean<mdash/>made of liquid rock at temperatures of \SIrange{1500}{2500}{\kelvin}<mdash/>with the watery ocean now covering our planet.
        The magma ocean convected easily,
        so material from deep below the surface was continuously being brought to the surface<fn>
        Ikoma, M., Elkins-Tanton, L., Hamano, K., &amp; Suckale, J. (2018).
        Water Partitioning in Planetary Embryos and Protoplanets with Magma Oceans.
        Space Science Reviews, 214(4), 76.
        </fn>.
        Despite its high temperatures and rocky composition,
        liquid water readily dissolved in the magma,
        until it reached the surface,
        where it lost some of this water to the atmosphere.
        Over a few million years much of the water dissolved in the magma ocean bubbled away into the super-heated steamy atmosphere,
        hundreds of times heavier than the puny atmosphere of our current Earth.
        For the few million years the magma ocean was molten at the surface<fn>

        Nature, 497(7451), 607.
        </fn>,
        and continually pumped water into the atmosphere.
        But 4 to 5 Myr after the giant collision,
        the magma ocean solidified and the atmosphere began to cool.
        Although there is no direct evidence (yet!) for when this happened,
        computer models suggest that within a few
        <em>hundreds to thousands</em> years,
        the atmosphere had cooled enough for the first<mdash/>ever<ndash/>rains to fall on the newly solidified Earth<fn>
        Ikoma et al., <m>\S 4.3</m>
        </fn>.
        The hydrosphere was born.
        These earliest oceans probably contained<mdash/>within a factor of two<mdash/>about as much water as the contemporary oceans do.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>How we characterize ancient oceans</title>
      <p>
        The chronology of Earth's hydrosphere nudges against the very start of the solar system,
        at least 4.547 billion years ago.
        But the first direct evidence<mdash/>evidence that one can hold in one's hand<mdash/>is younger,
        <em>only</em> 4.374 billions years old,
        and comes in the form of fragments of even older rocks,
        deposited on Earth's early crust as sedimentary rocks. \paragraphs{Zircons and inclusions} Sometimes the littlest packages have the largest surprises.
        This is certainly true of the zircon crystals found in the Jack Hills area of Western Australia.
        The rocks there (<xref ref="fig_jhzirc">Figure</xref> are
        <q>only</q>
        3 Ga old, and consist of sandstones and conglomerates clearly deposited in water on an ancient continent.
        Within those rocks are grains of zircon,
        a mineral typically formed in granitic magmas.
        Zircons are tough little minerals,
        and can be precisely dated using U-Pb dating methods<fn>
        Bowring, S. (2014).
        Early Earth: Closing the gap.
        Nature Geoscience, 7(3), 169 presents a brief review.
        </fn>.
        Hundreds of thousands of zircons from the Jack Hills have been dated,
        and the oldest<fn>
        Wilde, S. A., Valley, J. W., Peck, W. H., &amp; Graham, C. M. (2001).
        Evidence from detrital zircons for the existence of continental crust and oceans on the Earth 4.4 Gyr ago.
        Nature, 409(6817), 175.
        </fn> (See <xref ref="fig_jhzirc">Figure</xref>) formed at \num[separate-uncertainty = true]{4.404(8)} Ga, less than 100 My after the Earth-Theia collision!
        The zircons have another surprise:
        the oxygen isotopic ratios indicate that the magmas from which they formed clearly interacted with surface waters:
        an early ocean.
        While it is no bigger than the width of a human hair,
        the zircon in <xref ref="fig_jhzirc">Figure</xref>
        it has planet-wide implications as the oldest direct evidence for Earth's hydrosphere. \paragraphs{Sedimentary rocks} Many sedimentary rocks form by the erosion,
        transport and deposition of rock fragments in oceans,
        so they too are direct evidence of an active hydrosphere.
        The oldest sedimentary rocks on Earth are found in and around western Greenland and eastern Canada,
        and date to <nbsp/>3.75 Ga.
        These sedimentary rocks include cherts and banded iron formations formed on the ocean floor soon after the the last dregs of meteorite bombardment had stopped
        (<xref ref="fig_bif">Figure</xref>).
        Sedimentary rocks of every age are found since that time,
        so it is extremely likely that Earth has had stable oceans since then.

    <title>Archean and Proterozoic hydrosphere</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In an influential essay, Ariel Anbar noted the odd truth of the modern oceans.
        You'd expect that the vast majority of the surface oceans would thrive with life:
        basking in sunlight streaming through the clear, blue water;
        provided with abundant <m>CO_2</m>,
        and slurping up required nutrients dissolved in the water.
        In fact, most of the tropical oceans are a lifeless desert,
        because the water lacks trace metals
        (mostly metals like Fe, Mn, and Co)
        as well as nitrogen<fn>

        Nature, 506(7488), 307-315. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13068
        </fn>.
        This is paradoxical:
        why after some 4 Ga of evolution should life in the oceans be so ill-adapated to life in the oceans!
        The explanation is that the core machinery of life evolved not in the modern oceans,
        but in those from 4 Ga, and that ocean was far different chemically from the one we have now.
        Understanding the evolution of the oceans is essential for understanding how the basic machinery of life evolved as well.
        Biosphere, hydropshere and geosphere are intertwined not only today,
        but through time.
        Understanding the evolving compositions of the oceans is essential to understanding the evolution of Earth's climate.

      <title>The Archean: Hot, anoxic and iron-y</title>
      <p>
        Just about every aspect of the ancient oceans was different than the modern oceans,
        even such simple features as temperature.
        We saw in <xref ref="modern_sst">Section</xref>
        that typical sea surface temperatures in the modern ocean average about \SIrange{15}{20}{\celsius}. Although a fierce debate continues<fn>
        Garcia, A. K., Schopf, J. W., Yokobori, S. I., Akanuma, S., &amp; Yamagishi, A. (2017).
        Reconstructed ancestral enzymes suggest long-term cooling of Earth's photic zone since the Archean.
        Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 114(18), 4619-4624 is a recent discussion;
        see references to <xref ref="fig_historic_sst">Figure</xref> for a more complete list.
        </fn> on this, SST at 4.0 Ga might have been as hot as \SIrange{55}{85}{\celsius}, or <m>130</m> to <m>180^\circ F</m>,
        hot enough to safely cook chicken!
        As <xref ref="fig_historic_sst">Figure</xref>
        illustrates, SSTs have slowly decreased since then,
        arriving near modern temperatures only in the last 250 Ma.

        All data agrees that the Archean ocean had a substantially different chemistry than today's ocean.
        Prior to the Great Oxygenation Event at 2.5 Ga, oxygen would have been largely absent from the oceans,
        except for brief, local episodes<fn>

        Iron and chemically similar metals (Ni, Co and Mn, for example) readily dissolved into the anoxic ocean as reduced ions like <m>Fe^{2+}</m>,
        so the earliest oceans were 10,000 times more enriched in Fe than we see today.
        In such
        <q>ferrungous</q>
        or iron-rich environments,
        it is no wonder that life evolved to use these abundant metals.
        Life then as now depends upon gaining energy through reduction-oxidation reactions.
        The oldest of the molecular machines that conduct these reactions all have metal atoms at their core,
        metals abundant in the Archean<mdash/>but not contemporary<mdash/>oceans.
        While the deep oceans of the Archean were uniformly hot,
        anoxic and ferrungous,
        the continental slopes and shelves had their own peculiarity.
        Isotopic data from shales<mdash/>mud-rich sedimentary rocks deposited on the shallow and well-lit shelves<mdash/>indicate that relatively large portions<fn>

        The bacteria conducting all this photosynthesis lived principally in the oceans,
