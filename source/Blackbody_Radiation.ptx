  <title>Blackbody Radiation: What light and color can tell us about objects across the Universe</title>
  <subsection>
    <title>Light as the way objects radiate energy</title>
    <p>
      Electromagnetic radiation
      (which we'll abbreviate as EMR)
      is the formal name of what we casually call
      <q>light</q>. Radio waves; infra-red, visible and ultraviolet light;
      and x-rays are all different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.
      <em>EMR is emitted anytime an electron or other charged particle oscillates or is accelerated.</em>
      A Wi-Fi antenna, for example,
      emits radio waves when the electrons in the antenna oscillate in response to a signal from the unit.
      These radio waves propagate through the room until they hit your device's antenna,
      where the process is reversed.
      The radio waves accelerate electrons in that antenna,
      and your device interprets the resulting electrical signals as a text message from a friend.
      Light is how electrons communicate.
      The connection between light and heat should be coming in to focus.
      Temperature is the average kinetic energy of a group of molecules,
      molecules that are vibrating to and fro,
      molecules which contain lots of electrons.
      So any object made of matter will constantly radiate away energy as light.
      We clearly need to understand light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Einstein won his Nobel Prize not for his discovery of Relativity,
      but for his description of the nature of light.
      His insight was that that light can act both as a particle and as a wave,
      a complication we can safely ignore.
      For us, light is a wave,
      with a wavelength that determines its energy and color.
      Wavelength is the distance between the same parts of two adjacent waves,
      a definition made much clearer by <xref ref="fig_light">Figure</xref>.
      Light exists in a spectrum with wavelengths from the infinite to the smallest conceivable size.
      Energy is inversely proportional to wavelengths,
      so shorter waves have more energy.
      Typical radio waves
      (such as those broadcast in the AM and FM bands)
      have wavelengths ranging from kilometers to a meter.
      At the high energy end of the spectrum are the short wavelength x-rays and gamma rays.
      X-rays are effective visualizers of bones and teeth because these types of light pass easily through soft-tissue of the body,
      interacting more strongly with the hard calcified tissues of your bones.
      But their high energy requires that exposure to them be limited to avoid damage to the body.

      Roughly in the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum lies the
      <em>visible spectrum</em>,
      the only part of the electromagnetic spectrum of our eyes can sense.
      The familiar ROY-G-BIV stretches from <m>\SIrange{390 }{ 750}{\nano\metre}</m> wavelength,
      with blue light at the shorter and more energetic end of the visible spectrum.
      Above the blue end of the spectrum is the ultra-violet,
      or UV, part of the spectrum.
      The UV is relatively high energy light,
      as you know if you've ever had sunburn.
      Ultra-violet light is energetic enough to pass through the dead outer layers of skin and into the live cells just beneath.
      The UV light can damage the DNA in the cell's nucleus,
      killing off the cell and leading to peeling skin.
      Over exposure to UV light is the cause of skin cancer,
      the most common form of cancer in the United States<fn>

      Below the red end of the visible spectrum,
      and so at even lower energy, lies the infra-red (IR) portion of the spectrum.
      The IR happens to be the type of EMR radiated by the human body,
      as illustrated by the false-color photograph of <xref ref="fig_Hand_IR">Figure</xref>.
      This same photograph beautifully demonstrates the ability of some wavelengths of EMR to penetrate objects visible light cannot.
      Note that IR passes easily through both the trash bag and the subject's shirt,
      both of which are opaque to visible light.
      EMR is how electrons communicate,
      but electrons can only absorb light with appropriate energies.
      The molecules in the trash bag easily absorb the energy in visible light,
      but cannot absorb the lower energies of IR radiation,
      so the IR passes easily through the material.
      Human eyes apparently absorb the energy in visible light efficiently,
      and that's because some 4 billion years of evolution has adapted our eyes to see the portion of the spectrum in which the Sun emits most of its light.
      This, in turn,
      is determined by the Sun's surface temperature: Light, heat,
      temperature and color are all intertwined.

    <title>An object's temperature determines its color and spectrum of emitted radiation</title>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Color and temperature</title>
      <p>
        Most people have gazed absent-mindedly into a hot fire and stared at the white-hot coals.
        Few may have come back hours later and recognized the now black and cool coals as the same that were glowing earlier.
        When hot, the coals glowed fiercely with whitish-blue color,
        but as they cooled they slowly faded to yellow, orange,
        a deep and dull red, and finally apparently stopped glowing at all.
        This recapitulation of the spectrum of visible light is no accident.
        We know now that temperature is just a measure of kinetic energy,
        and that the kinetic energy of the molecules in the hot coals was far higher than that in the cool coals.
        Unsurprisingly, hotter coals emit more,
        and higher energy light,
        which happens to have bluer colors and shorter wavelengths.
        Cooler coals emit longer wavelength, redder light.
        (Yes, this is exactly the opposite of the commonly used description of blue as a
        <q>cool</q>
        color and red as a
        <q>warm</q>
        color.
        Color is as much an artistic idea as a scientific one,
        probably to the consternation of both camps.)
        The color of light emitted by a glowing object is determined by its temperature,
        a relationship good <em>anywhere</em> in the Universe.

      <title>Color and spectrum</title>
      <p>
        Not all molecules or atoms in a given object will all have the same energy.
        A few molecules or atoms will have much more energy than the average,
        while many more will have less energy than average.
        So real objects, even if they are of uniform temperature,
        will emit not just one wavelength of EMR, but a range,
        an entire spectrum.
        The wavelength of the average emitted EMR will be related to the average temperature of the object's surface,
        and hence to the color of the object.
        Think about the implications of this:
        the EMR emitted by any object in the universe carries with it information on the temperature of the emitter.
        In principle,
        we can measure the temperature of an object across the Universe,
        simply by looking at the spectrum of EMR it emits.
        This remarkable and useful behavior of matter is summarized in the concept of the Black-body Spectrum.

    <title>The Black-body Spectrum</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        <em>A
        <q>black-body</q>
        is simply an object that absorbs all EMR falling on it</em>.
        Observation 2 in <xref ref="obs_2">Section</xref>
        says that an object at constant temperature must absorb and emit energy at the same rate,
        so it should come as little surprise that a black-body also emits electromagnetic energy,
        and does so in a characteristic way.
        Our goal in this section is to use these concepts to calculate the average temperature of Earth's surface,
        using only the energy radiated from the Sun as an input.
        These same tools are being used by NASA to calculate the surface temperatures of planets orbiting distant suns.
        It's heady and important stuff.

      <title>Wein's Law: the connection between Temperature and Color</title>
      <p>
        We have already guessed that hotter objects should release more blue and energetic light than a cooler object.
        This relationship was first quantified by Wilhelm Wien, in 1893,
        the same year the first American-built gasoline-powered car hit the roads in Springfield, Massachusetts<fn>
        Flink, James (1990).
        The Automobile Idea.
        MIT Press. p. 5.
        ISBN 0262560550.
        </fn>.
        Wein's Law gives the relationship between the temperature of a black-body radiator and the wavelength of EMR the object emits most strongly:
        <men>
          \lambda_{max}=\frac{\SI{2.9d6}{\nano\metre\kelvin}}{T}
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        As we expect,
        wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature:
        as one increases the other decreases,
        as shown on <xref ref="fig_weins_law">Figure</xref>.

        Because of the way the human eye works,
        we perceive the color of black-body radiators as a series from deep red to white to blue,
        as shown in <xref ref="fig_weins_law">Figure</xref>.
        If you happen to be reading this anytime from September to March,
        you can see the power of Wein's Law for yourself by looking at the constellation Orion,
        which rides high in the sky during the Northern Hemisphere winter.
        Or, you can glance at <xref ref="fig_Orion">Figure</xref>,
        which shows an actual photograph of Orion in all its glory.
        In the upper left of the photograph is the red supergiant star Betelgeuse,
        a star so large that if it were placed at the Sun's location, Mars, Earth, Venus and Mercury would all lie within the star.
        Match the color of Betelgeuse in the photograph to the colors-temperature relationship given in <xref ref="fig_weins_law">Figure</xref>
        and determine the stars' temperature.

      <title>Planck's Law: All Blackbody Spectra have the same shape</title>
      <p>
        In the year 1900 CE, Max Planck announced<fn>
        Planck, M. (1914).
        The Theory of Heat Radiation.
        Masius, M. (transl.) (2nd ed.).
        P. Blakiston's Son &amp; Co.
        </fn> an astonishing discovery:
        the spectra of all black-bodies have the same
        <q>shape,</q>
        with a long tail at the low energy,
        long wavelength end, a peak as predicted by Wein,
        and then a quick drop-off at the high energy,
        short wavelength end of the spectrum.
        This spectral shape is shown in <xref ref="fig_planks">Figure</xref>,
        where you can see the spectra for objects ranging from <m>\SIrange{2000}{12000}{K}</m>.
        The circles on the curves give the location of the peak wavelength from Wein's Law,
        as shown in <xref ref="tab_weins_results">Table</xref>.
        Note how each curve nestles neatly within its neighbors,
        with hotter objects emitting more,
        and bluer, light than cooler objects.
        Planck's law tells us that blackbody radiators radiate heat in a predictable and universal way.

      <title>Stefan-Boltzmann Law: Hotter objects release more energy than cooler objects. Much more</title>
      <p>
        The final aspect of the heat flow from blackbody radiators we need to understand is the relationship between an object's surface temperature and the amount of heat it releases.
        While <xref ref="fig_planks">Figure</xref>
        shows qualitatively that hotter objects emit more heat than cooler objects,
        we need to quantify this relationship to understand Earth's climate.
        The relationship between the equilibrium surface temperature and the heat radiated by a blackbody radiator was first determined experimentally by Stefan (in 1879 CE) and theoretically by Boltzmann in 1884 CE. For an object with an equilibrium surface temperature <m>T_{eq}</m>,
        the amount of energy emitted,
        <m>E</m>, per square meter of area is
        <men>
          E\propto T^4_{eq}
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>Proportional</q>
        means that as the equilibrium temperature <m>T_{eq}</m> increases,
        so too does E, the energy emitted.
        Anyone who has a job knows what proportional means:
        typically pay is proportional to hours worked.
        We can convert any proportion to an equation by inserting a
        <q>constant of proportionality.</q>
        For the work example, that constant is your rate of pay.
        The proportionality constant converts hours worked into money earned.
        So too for the Stefan-Boltzman Law.
        The proportionality constant,
        abbreviated with the Greek letter <m>\sigma</m> (sigma),
        converts temperature into an energy,
        equal to <m>\SI{5.67d-8}{\watt\meter^{-2}\kelvin^{-4}}</m>.
        <men>
          E=\sigma T^4_{eq}
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that temperature is raised to the fourth power.
        Doubling the temperature of an object means it will release <m>2^4=16</m> times more energy!
        <xref ref="">Figure</xref> shows the heat radiated from an object the Sun's temperature is quite low,
        but the heat emitted by an object at
        <m>\SI{12000}{kelvins}</m> is nearly 19 times as much.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Why do we care about blackbody radiation anyway?</title>
      <p>
        The three laws of blackbody radiation we just reviewed are powerful tools for understanding the Universe.
        But a more local application is more helpful:
        let us determine the Sun's surface temperature.
        Simply from the color of the Sun's light, Wien's Law suggest that the Sun's surface should be around <m>\SI{6000}{kelvins}</m>,
        an astonishingly easy and surprisingly accurate answer.
        But Planck's law and the Stefan-Boltzmann Law will allow us to do better.
        <xref ref="fig_solar">Figure</xref>
        shows the Sun's measured spectrum
        (in gray, determined from satellite observations)
        and the ideal black body spectra of objects at <m>\SI{5730}{kelvins}</m>,
        <m>\SI{5780}{kelvins}</m>, and <m>\SI{5830}{kelvins}</m>.
        What is your best estimate for the Sun's temperature?
        While the Sun is not a perfect black body radiator,
        the spectra on <xref ref="fig_solar">Figure</xref>
        indicates the Sun has an effective temperature of <m>\SI{5780}{kelvins}</m>
        (the yellow line in the Figure).
        We will use this value often enough to warrant memorizing it<fn>
        Most sources
        (for example,
        <url href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html">NASA</url>
        )
        give <m>T_{eq}=\SI{5780}{kelvins}</m>.
        In keeping with the goal of accepting imprecisions of <m>\lt 1\%</m>, I've rounded <m>T_{eq}</m> to <m>\SI{5780}{kelvins}</m>,
        with an error of <m>\lt 0.03\%</m>
        </fn>.
        This value agrees nicely with our estimate of 6000 K from Wein's Law and the Sun's apparent color,
        and represents our first step toward understanding Earth's surface temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a moment to find the boundary between the ultraviolet,
        visible and infrared radiation on the horizontal axis of <xref ref="fig_planks">Figure</xref>.
        The Sun's effective temperature is so low that nearly 50% of its radiation is in the infrared part of the spectrum<fn>
        This is the average power output from brute numerical integration of the E-490 and ASTM G173-03 top-of-atmosphere solar spectra models over the 120 nm to 1 mm interval with boundaries for the visual at 400 and 750 nm
        </fn>.
        Only <m>44\%</m> of the Sun's energy actually falls in the visible spectrum.
        This comparison is somewhat unfair;
        after all the visible part of the spectrum is narrow compared to the infrared.
        The concentration of light in that narrow visible band is what shapes Earth processes,
        including life.
