  <title>Hinterlands and Wastelands</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Even the casual decisions we make have global implications because of the way the global economy works.
      Few people have the time,
      ability or interest to gather,
      grow and hunt for all their needs.
      Instead, the vast majority of people (OECD and non-OECD residents alike) are part of a global economic system,
      with individuals devoting labor to a tiny part of the cycle that delivers food,
      goods and services, and removes trash,
      waste, and effluents to households.
      All this activity takes place at or near Earth's surface,
      and so inevitably affects all of Earth's natural spheres.
      The next time you peel back and enjoy the fruit of a banana,
      recall that growing, harvesting,
      transporting and consuming that banana is possible only through contributions of the biosphere,
      geosphere,
      atmosphere and hydrosphere.
      Oh, and a significant contribution from the economics of the Anthroposphere.

    <title>The Circular Flow Model</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The
        <q>circular flow</q>
        model is a simple but insightful way of visualizing this economic activity (See <xref ref="fig_circ_flow">Figure</xref>).
        Households and firms form the heart of the economy with individuals in the households providing labor to firms,
        which in turn pay wages to the individuals
        (as shown by the lower set of red and green arrows in the figure).
        Households then purchase goods and services from firms
        (as shown by the upper set of red and green arrows),
        thus completing two intersecting flows of goods, cash and work.

      <title>Hinterlands Provide Resources</title>
      <p>
        But this model is insufficient:
        the firms need material to build goods,
        and households need food, not just wages, to live.
        So another, outer circle is needed<fn>

        This circle illustrates the extraction of natural resources from the geosphere and biosphere that provides the raw materials for human culture.
        Some of these products
        (metal ores, coal)
        are used to make other products
        (automobiles and smart phones)
        while some (fish) are used directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        For millenia these natural resources were found near human settlements.
        They had to be,
        as travel was difficult and transport of large volumes of material impossible.
        But the evolution of cities changed this.
        The high population density and built environment in a city required that natural resources be extracted not from the city itself,
        but from a more distant <em>hinterland</em>.
        This hinterland (literally
        <q>behind place</q>
        ) had to be of sufficient size and accessibility to provide the urban areas with the raw materials, water,
        food and energy needed to fuel the city.
        Now, the
        <q>hinterland</q>
        is global: that banana you ate last paragraph was likely grown in Guatemala,
        shipped in boats built in China,
        and fueled with oil mined in Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hinterlands can be messy places;
        extraction of even high grade resources generally requires enormous investments of energy and labor.
        <xref ref="fig_hill_top">Figure</xref>
        shows the results of over 30 years of mining coal in the Hobet-21 mine of West Virginia.
        This is a
        <q>hilltop removal</q>
        mine; the valuable coal is exposed by scrapping off and dumping
        (in stream valleys)
        the overlying rock.
        The yellow line indicates the total area of hilltop removed over the 30 year life-time of the mine.
        The upper part of the image shows the island of Manhattan,
        to the same scale.
        The coal mined from Hebet-21 in 2007 CE alone would provide Manhattan with all its energy needs for less than 2 months.
        The Anthroposphere requires extensive hinterlands!
        This is made startlingly clear by <xref ref="fig_pipelines">Figure</xref>,
        which shows that of all the raw materials provided by hinterlands,
        water is by far the most important.

      <title>Households and Firms Convert Resources and Energy to Products and Wastes</title>
      <p>
        After these natural resources are extracted from Earth's spheres,
        firms convert them to products and services consumed by other firms and households.
        The coal mined at Hebet-21, for example, was cleaned,
        crushed and transported by train cars to power plants,
        where the coal was burned to provide energy for offices,
        factories and homes.
        You can imagine that an office worker is designing a new generation of smart phone,
        destined to be manufactured at the factory,
        and eventually sold to an individual householder.
        All this activity is represented by the blue,
        red and green arrows of <xref ref="fig_circ_flow">Figure</xref>.
        While just about every OECD resident is part of this global circulation of economic activity,
        just 5 countries (China,
        the US, India, Brazil and Russia) consumed over 50% of all globally extracted natural resources in 2009 CE<fn>

        </fn>.
        On average, every person on the globe consumed about 11 metric tonnes (23 tons,
        about the weight of 4 full-grown elephants) of resources in 2017 CE<fn>

      <title>Wastelands Receive Waste Products</title>
      <p>
        But all of this activity also generates wastes.
        Some of this waste is a direct consequence of the activity,
        such as the smoke of burning coal escaping from the narrow smokestack in <xref ref="fig_coal_powerplant">Figure</xref>.
        By far though, the greatest waste produced by humans is sewage,
        which you can think of as the natural result of
        (and part of the need for)
        all that water we use.<xref ref="fig_ins_and_outs">Figure</xref>
        shows how all the inputs are used,
        and where the waste products go.
        About 96% of those wastes are emitted,
        with various levels of pre-treatment,
        into the hydrosphere and atmosphere<fn>

        </fn> In parallel with the idea of
        <q>hinterlands,</q>
        we'll call these dumping areas
        <q>wastelands.</q>

    <title>Hinterlands and Wastelands are the 5 spheres</title>
    <p>
      Clearly the hinterlands that supply natural resources to our civilization,
      and the wastelands in which we dilute the resulting waste products,
      are just Earth's five natural spheres.
      These spheres are clearly deeply ingrained in our global economy,
      where they play essential and irreplaceable roles.
      Resources are most valuable when they are highly concentrated.
      This makes their extraction, refining,
      and transport much easier to the firms or other entities which produce the resource.
      So resources<mdash/>even those in the most remote hinterlands<mdash/>tend to be owned by private concerns,
      or national or other governments.
      These same entities will go through enormous efforts<mdash/>including removing entire hilltops
      (see <xref ref="fig_hill_top">Figure</xref>),
      to extract these concentrated resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the whole the point of wastelands is to do just the opposite:
      to dilute the concentrated waste stream and remove it from the Anthroposphere.
      The least appealing of these waste streams<mdash/>sewage<mdash/>is an excellent
      (if disgusting)
      example.
      The infrastructure involved with containing,
      transporting, treating and diluting sewage is expensive:
      in 2014 CE alone,
      state and local governments in the United States spent approximately $50 billion,
      roughly $200 per person,
      on maintenance and construction of sewers and related infrastructure<fn>

      accessed 4 March 2017.
      </fn> After being treated,
      the sewage is dumped into rivers, lakes and oceans,
      where currents both carry it away from the source and begin to dilute the sewage with cleaner water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same process happens to gaseous wastes,
      for example the smoke escaping the smokestack in <xref ref="fig_coal_powerplant">Figure</xref>.
      The waste products of combustion,
      including <m>CO_2</m>, eventually make thier way in to the atmosphere.
      This process is relatively inexpensive:
      unlike the hinterlands, the cost of using the wastelands is nearly free.
      After all, no one owns the air.
