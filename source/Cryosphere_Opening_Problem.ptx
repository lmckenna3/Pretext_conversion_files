    What's the highest point in <em>your</em> country?
    How tall is it?
    And for how long?
    We tend to think of the world's high points as permanently lofty,
    fixed edifices towering above the rest of the country.
    Sweden's high point<fn>
    The original article
    (in Swedish)

    </fn> is the southern peak of Kebnekaises (
    <q>Cauldron Crest</q>
    in the local Sami language);
    the peak is not rock but a glacier (shown in <xref ref="fig_kebenkaises">Figure</xref>.
    Professor Gunhild Ninis Rosqvist has been measuring the height of Kebnekaises for years as part of her ongoing research on climate change.
    The summer of 2018 CE brought record heat to Europe,
    including the Arctic reaches of northern Sweden and Kebnekaises.
    During just July of 2018, Dr.
    Rosqvist's measurements showed that Kebnekaises melted from \SI{2101}{\metre} to \SI{2097}{\metre} above sea level,
    a loss of by \SI{4}{\metre} at the astonishing rate of \SI{14}{\centi\metre\per\day}. Dr.
    Rosqvist noted that
    <q>The result of the hot summer will be a record loss of snow and ice in the mountains</q>
    So much of the glacier melted that the northern peak of Kebenkaise became Sweden's high point,
    at least until the next winter,
    when new snow fall might bring the southern peak back to its former prominence.
    Seasonal melting of snow and ice is part of the natural cycle of the cryosphere<mdash/>the part of Earth made of ice.
    But the unprecedented melting experienced by Kebenkaise in the summer of 2018 is unfortunately just one example of the large-scale melt-back of Earth's cryosphere.
    This melting is not just a local inconvenience,
    but a regional and global one,
    affecting everything from the stability of individual homes,
    to water supply for major cities,
    to the planet's equilibrium temperature.
    As Professor Shawn Marshall noted<fn>

    <q>The atlas of the world will be redrawn as coastal boundaries,
    navigable waterways, river systems,
    and population centers shift in the coming decades.</q>
    The problem we face is simple:
    how do we mitigate or adapt our society to these real-time changes?
