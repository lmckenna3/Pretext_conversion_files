    <caption>Water is just weird, and weirdness not shared by substances chemically similar to water. The upper panel shows the melting and boiling points of water (<m>H_2O</m>) and the four analogs to water made with elements in the same period as <m>O</m>: sulfur (<m>S</m>), selenium (<m>Se</m>), tellurium (<m>Te</m>), and polonium (<m>Po</m>), plotted by the weight of each molecule. Predicting the melting and boiling points of water based on these analogs is straightforward: just estimate the trend of each line to the atomic mass of water, 18 amu. While the prediction is easy to do, it is <em>wildly</em> wrong! The actual melting and boiling points are \SI{83}{\degreeCelsius} and \SI{170}{\degreeCelsius} warmer than the predictions. Why? (Data from CRC Handbook, 74th Edition, 1993) The <em>lower panel</em> shows the density of liquid water at temperatures of \SIrange{0}{10}{\degreeCelsius}.Note the density reaches a maximum near \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius}, not \SI{0}{\degreeCelsius}. Ice has a density of \SI{916.2}{\kilogram\per\metre^3}, which on scale of the graph would be \SI{17}{\metre} (56 feet) below the graph.</caption>

  <figure xml:id="fig_H_bonding">
    <caption>Water's weird behavior is due to hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and oxygen atoms in adjacent water molecules. Within molecules, the <m>H</m> and <m>O</m> atoms are held together with strong covalent bonds, shown as the cylinders connecting the red <m>O</m> atoms and white <m>H</m> atoms. Oxygen's stronger affinity for electrons gives it a partial negative charge <m>\delta^{-}</m>, while the hydrogen develops a partial positive charge (<m>\delta^{+}</m>). These partial charges form hydrogen bonds (yellow), only one twentieth the strength of the covalent bonds. Each hydrogen atom establishes one hydrogen bond, and each oxygen atom accepts two hydrogen bonds, so most water molecules have a total of 4 hydrogen bonds. The kinetic energy of room-temperature (and body-temperature) water is about the same as the strength of hydrogen bonds, so a given bond breaks and reforms about \SI{1e12}{s^{-1}}, or one trillion times per second. The figure was  made with Jmol.</caption>

    Despite the overwhelming importance of water to every aspect of science, culture and economy, the microscopic structure of water is still an area of intense research. But at room temperature and below, liquid water resembles the structure shown above, with 4 water molecules arranged in a tetrahedron (gray outline) around a central fifth molecule. Each of molecules at the corner of this tetrahedron in turn will be arranged in a similar way, such that water consists of a interwoven and extensive matrix of interconnected molecules.

    <caption>A model for soil water, the water table, and groundwater is easy to make with a glass of ice and water, here dyed red to make it visible. Near the top of the glass, air occupies all the void spaces between the ice particles. Lower in the glass, water fills an increasingly larger proportion of the void spaces, until the voids between ice particles are fully occupied by water. The red food coloring in the water makes the transition from the under-saturated upper layer to the fully saturated groundwater layer particularly striking. Inserting a straw into the unsaturated zone wouldn't help quench your thirst; only air would be drawn uo the straw. So too with real groundwater. Wells for extracting groundwater must extend at least to the water table to gain access to the resource.</caption>

Rivers, lakes and other standing bodies of water form from the baseflow provided by the intersection of the water table with the surface, as shown on the far right of the diagram. The <em>lower panel</em> (modified from Figure 3 of Winter, T. C. (Ed.). (1998). Ground water and surface water: a single resource.

    The intersection of sea level and the blue curve marks the proportion of Earth coverd by land:
    currently about 30%, and the oceans about 70%. But knowing the shelves are really temporarily submerged parts of the continents suggests a different value: 35% for the continents and 65% for the oceans.

    <caption>Ocean acidity determines marine organisms ability to construct shells. Lower pH means higher acidity and more difficulty making shells. Global variations in pH are relatively small compared to the variations we've seen in other ocean properties, partly because the pH scale is logarithmic, and partly because of natural buffering of pH by the many forms of <m>CO_2</m> dissolved in the oceans. In the tropics and temperate areas, pH is lower (more acidic) in summer and higher in winter. This pattern is reversed in the poles, with lower pH in winter and higher pH in summer. This odd pattern is due to the interplay of light and nutrient supplies affecting photosynthesis in the water column. The map shown here is for 2005 CE; since then pH has dropped roughly 0.03 units, equivalent to a 7% increase in acidity just since this mimage was made. (Takahashi, T., Sutherland, S. C., Chipman, D.

The relative ease with which this process takes place is given by the
    <q>saturation state.</q>
    Higher saturation states lead to easier shell building; lower states indicate more difficult shell building and even shell dissolution into the oceans. Warm, tropical oceans have higher saturation states than colder temperate waters. The map shown here is for 2005 CE; since then saturation states have dropped roughly 0.12 units (Takahashi, T., Sutherland, S. C., Chipman, D. W., Goddard, J.

Coral reefs will transition to net dissolving before end of century.

This history largely reflects how far from the sun the water formed. Earth (blue circle and line, the Moon (grey rectangle), Mars (red rectangle) and even the largest asteroid Ceres (white rectangle) all have hydrogen and nitrogen isotopic ratios near 0. Comets formed 1000s of AU from the sun in the Oort cloud (yellow box), and comets formed near 30 AU (green box) have hydrogen and nitrogen ratios distinct from Earth, and clearly are not the source of Earth's water.

    <caption>The hydrosphere's early history. Delivery of carbon- and water-rich asteroids to the inner solar system began as early as 8 to 20 My after CAIs, long before the final moon-forming collision between Earth and Theia. The wet asteroids from the outer solar system delivered the equivalent of 3 to 5 times the mass of today's oceans to the still-forming Earth. The magma ocean resulting from the collision delivered much of this water to the hot, steam-rich atmosphere surrounding our nascent planet. Once the magma ocean solidified, steam condensed to water and the very first rain fell to the surface, forming the hydrosphere. This early liquid ocean was most likely repeatedly boiled back into the atmosphere by meteorites striking the surface, a process that may have continued until 4 Ga.(Marchi, S., Bottke, W.

One such model mathematically grows Jupiter and Saturn over a brief interval a few million years after solar system formation began. The horizontal axis shows the orbital radius of each object plotted, while the vertical axis gives the eccentricity of the orbit. Asteroids (the colored dots) are color coded by their distance to the Sun. Red and green asteroids are relatively dry, blue and cyan asteroids are relatively wet.

    <caption>Debate still rages on the ancient ocean's temperature. One school of thought (exemplified in the model results shown in yellow in pane a) argues that SST were roughly the same as those now. Well-documented ice ages (pane c), average weathering rates, the faint-young sun, even the existence of life (pane d) all argue for low SST over geologic history. But the evidence for hot oceans (isotopic results shown in red, green and purple; ezymatic evidence in blue in pane a) are consistent and are based on a wide variety of observations. Archean and Proterozoic oceans were hot, as high as \SIrange{55}{85}{\celsius}, and have cooled slowly over time. There is some evidence of temperature increases following both oxygenation steps (2.5 and 0.7 Ga) of the atmosphere. The net cooling of the surface oceans in this case is on the order of \SI[per-mode=symbol]{15}{\celsius\per\giga\year}. Which school is the correct one is still impossible to tell.

    <caption>The oxidation state and trace element content of the oceans over time. Prior to the Great Oxidation event, the vast majority of the oceans<mdash/>from surface to bottom) were poor in dissolved oxygen (anoxic) but rich in dissolved  iron, <m>Fe^{2+}</m> (ferruginous), as shown by the brown shaded regions. Occasional oxygen-rich oases may have briefly bubbled-up in shallow oceans after the evolution, <nbsp/>3 Ga, of oxygen-producing photosynthesis. The oceans above the continental slopes were anoxic, ferruginous and rich in <m>H_2S</m>, or euxinic, a condition recorded by abundant black shales from the period. Following the GOE, an oxygen-rich surface layer (in blue) spread globally, but anoxic and ferruginous continued in the deep ocean. Only after the NOE did bottom waters of the ocean become oxygenated, allowing soon thereafter for the evolution of large animals for the first time. Note (bottom panel) the sudden expansion of metazoan animals at the time of the NOE. Euxinic areas, though rare now, are still found in some areas of intense biological activity. (Lyons, T.

    <caption>The ENSO includes three end-member stages, here illustrated by maps of SST differences from normal conditions. At normal conditions (third panel from top) SST differences are small (white areas) and the few areas of larger differences (yellow and blue areas) are small and scattered. During the classical El Ni&#xf1;o (second panel from top) the warm pool sloshes across the Pacific Ocean, piling up against South America. This is attended by a deeper thermocline and reduced upwelling, both detrimental to the productive areas along the coast. The
    <q>Central Pacific</q>
    form of the El Ni&#xf1;o also has the warm pool moving eastward, but it stalls in the central Pacific ocean. After return to normal conditions following an El Ni&#xf1;o, a La Ni&#xf1;a can form (bottom panel) where the strengthened cold tongue surges westward at the equator. The La Ni&#xf1;a SST cooling is generally much less than the warming associated with an El Ni&#xf1;o. (Wang, C., Deser, C., Yu, J. Y., DiNezio, P., &amp; Clement, A. (2012).
