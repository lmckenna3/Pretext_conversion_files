        Greenhouse gasses in Earth's atmosphere absorb infra-red radiation emitted by Earth's surface.
        The energy is re-emitted by the gasses, warming Earth's surface.
        This is the greenhouse effect.

        Naturally occurring greenhouse gasses warm Earth's surface by \SI{33}{\kelvin} or nearly
        <m>{60}^{\circ}</m> F. This natural greenhouse effect is crucial to the maintenance of life-friendly conditions on the planet.

        Feedback loops connect the concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere to processes in the geosphere,
        hydrosphere and biosphere.
        These feedback loops maintain Earth's climate on timescales from centuries to billions of years.

        Changes in insolation and albedo with latitude influence the climate at each latitude.
        Earth's orbital obliquity imposes seasonal changes on climate as well.
