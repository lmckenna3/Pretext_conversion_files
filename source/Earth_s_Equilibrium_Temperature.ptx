  <title>Putting it all together: Earth's equilibrium temperature</title>
  <subsection>
    <title>An equilibrium temperature for Earth</title>
    <p>
      You don't need to precisely know Earth's temperature to realize the Sun's surface is far hotter than that of our planet.
      So, Observation 1 from <xref ref="obs_1">Section</xref>
      tells us that the Sun will radiate energy to Earth,
      an unsurprising but now understood result.
      But Observation 2
      (<xref ref="obs_2">Section</xref>)
      has a role to play as well:
      to first order, Earth's surface temperature changes
      (until recently)
      very slowly,
      so we must be in thermal equilibrium with the Universe.
      We must emit as much energy into space as we absorb from the Sun.
      Here's a thought experiment: How much warmer would Earth's surface become if,
      for just one day, Earth were to absorb,
      but not emit one day's worth of solar energy?
      If that energy penetrates just \SI{1}{\metre} into the surface,
      the answer<fn>
      Roughly, assume one day's solar irradiation is uniformly spread over a \SI{1}{\metre} deep layer of 75% water and 25% rock.
      Then <m>\Delta T=\Delta H/(c_p*mass)=\SI{1361}{\watt}\cdot \SI{86400}{\second}\cdot .3/(\SI{0.75}{\metre^3}\cdot\SI{4000}{\joule\kilo\gram^{-1}\kelvin^{-1}}\cdot \SI{1000}{\kilo\gram\metre^3} + \SI{0.25}{\metre^3}\cdot\SI{850}{\joule\kilo\gram^{-1}\kelvin^{-1}}\cdot \SI{2650}{\kilo\gram\metre^3})=2.5 K</m> See page 48 of notebook #1.
      </fn> is an astonishing
      <m>\SI{2.5}{\kelvin}</m>, or <m>4.5\ ^{\circ}F</m>!
      In one day!
      Clearly Earth is near thermal equilibrium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near, but not at, which is why global warming is happening.
      The rate of global warming is roughly 0.1 K per decade.
      So you can already guess that the imbalance between incoming and outgoing heat can be tiny and yet still have an important climatological effect.

    <title>The factors that matter</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Before we derive Earth's equilibrium temperature,
        let us sketch out our plan of action.
        We know from Observation 1 that heat radiated from the Sun to Earth warms our planet.
        We know from Observation 2 that Earth must emit just as much heat back into space.
        The only heat flow mechanism capable of removing heat from Earth to space is radiation,
        which means Earth will behave like a blackbody radiator,
        warming until its temperature is hot enough to radiate into space the same amount energy as it receives from the Sun.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Insolation and the Solar Constant</title>
      <p>
        The <em>in</em>coming <em>sol</em>ar radia<em>tion</em>
        is given the lovely term insolation.
        At this time in the Sun's history,
        and at our distance from the Sun,
        the insolation we receive at the top of our atmosphere averages about \SI{1361} {\watt\per\metre^2} (W stands for a Watt,
        a unit of power, or rate at which energy is produced or consumed.
        A typical college student running up a flight of stairs in 2 seconds produces about 1361 W).
        This value is important enough to warrant its own term,
        the <em>Solar Constant</em>,
        its own symbol, <m>S_0</m>, and a nod towards memorization.
        To visualize this amount of energy,
        take a large LED flood light,
        say one equivalent to a 90 W incandescent bulb.
        Plug it in, turn it on, close your eyes,
        and stare at it from about 10 inches away.
        Now imagine that kind of bulb covering the entire side of the Earth facing the Sun.
        That's how much energy the Sun provides the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Solar Constant applies only to Earth and only to now.
        As we will see later, the Sun is slowly getting brighter,
        by about 7% per <em>billion</em> years.
        The insolation a planet receives depends inversely upon the squared distance between the planet and the Sun,
        so Mercury, which is only 0.7 times as far from the Sun as Earth,
        receives almost twice the insolation Earth receives.
        The minor planet Pluto, over 50 times farther from the Sun than Earth,
        receives a paltry 1/2500th of the energy we receive.
        The otherwise scientifically-accurate movie
        <em>The Martian</em> missed this point.
        On Mars, the Sun is less than half as bright as on Earth.
        The intrepid Matt Damon should have been walking around in what we would consider a semi-dark landscape.

      <title>Albedo, and why Peruvians are painting the Andes white</title>
      <p>
        The story was oddly popular, and would be funny if it weren't so sad.
        In June of 2010 CE, the BBC published<fn>
        http://www.bbc.com/news/10333304,
        published June 17,2010, accessed June 17, 2015
        </fn> pictures of Peruvian Eduardo Gold painting a mountainside white,
        in an attempt to bring back the glaciers that supplied drinking water to his town's residents.
        Although his actions were widely derided, he was no crackpot:
        he had just won a $200,000 prize from the World Bank for his proposal to return glaciers to that part of the Andes.
        His idea was rooted in the physics we have just been studying.
        The white paint, he reasoned,
        would reflect solar energy back into the atmosphere,
        thus reducing the temperature of the ground,
        and perhaps encouraging glacial regrowth.
        While his intervention will have only local effects on climate,
        the larger idea,
        that reflecting heat lowers temperature,
        is crucial to Earth's climate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take Gold's experiment with paint and make it global.
        Imagine two planets, equidistant from the Sun.
        One planet is perfectly white,
        reflecting all energy falling on it.
        The other is perfectly black,
        absorbing all energy incident upon it.
        It makes sense that the highly reflective white planet would be colder than the highly absorbing black body,
        even though they receive the same insolation,
        because they don't absorb that energy equally.
        The proportion of energy hitting a planet that is reflected back into space is the planet's <em>albedo</em>,
        from Latin <em>albus</em> 'white'. Fans of the Harry Potter novels will have no trouble remembering that something white,
        like Albus Dumbledore's beard and hair,
        reflects all of the light hitting it.
        <men>
          Albedo \equiv\frac{Reflected Energy}{Incident Energy}
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        Albedo is the proportion of energy hitting a planet that the planet doesn't absorb.
        Earth's average albedo is about 0.30,
        which means Earth reflects about 30% of the sun light falling on it.
        You must distinguish this reflected light from light Earth emits itself!
        This reflected sunlight is what makes Earth visible to the naked eye,
        or to camera in orbit around Earth or other planets
        (<xref ref="fig_saturnearth">Figure</xref>).
        A planet absorbs the proportion (1-A) of the light incident upon it.
        Venus has an albedo of about 0.9, so it reflects 90% and absorbs the remaining 10% of sun light falling upon it.
        The Moon has just the opposite behavior,
        with an albedo of 0.11, it is as dark as charcoal.
        It looks bright hanging in the night sky only because it is so much brighter than the surrounding blackness of space.

      <title>Your Algebra teacher was right: it does help to know the formula for the area of a sphere</title>
      <p>
        Finally we need to recognize one odd twist of geometry about how the Sun warms Earth's surface.
        The Earth is of course a sphere,
        but the Sun's light falls on a disk of the same radius.
        Figure 3.19 shows a planet warmed by the Sun,
        which is off the edge of the figure to the left.
        That heat has to warm the entire planet,
        as shown by the dull red coloring of the planet facing away from the Sun.
        But light falls only on the apparent disk of the planet,
        as shown by the shadow of the planet in black on the right of the figure.
        A sphere has four times the surface area of a disk of the same radius,
        so on average a planet's surface receives only <m>1/4</m> of the insolation at the top of the atmosphere.

    <title>Steven Hawkins be damned</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Public speaking and doing math:
        two of the least favorite activities of college students.
        Alas, ability at public speaking and math also top the list of skills required by employers and graduate schools.
        So in <xref ref="fig_teqderivation">figure</xref>
        we derive the equilibrium temperature of Earth,
        using all of the information presented in the chapter.
        The math is on the left; a verbal description is on the right.
        Throughout E stands for energy,
        and all values refer to those for Earth,
        except for the insolation, <m>S_0</m>.
        So after a long pursuit,
        we have it: Earth's equilibrium surface temperature, <m>T_{eq}</m>,
        is \SI{255}K, \SI{-18}{\celsius}, or
        <m>-1^{\circ}</m>F. The more general result,
        applicable to any just about any object warmed by the light of a star, is
        <men xml:id="eq_teq">
          T_{eq}=\left[\frac{S_0 \cdot (1-A)}{4 \sigma}\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}
        </men>
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>What does it mean?</title>
      <p>
        Understanding the relationship between insolation (<m>S_0</m>),
        albedo (A) and equilibrium temperature (<m>T_{eq}</m>) is crucial,
        and a brief look at how each term on the right of <xref ref="eq_teq">Equation</xref>
        contributes to the results is helpful.
        The quarter power in the equation means that large changes in insolation or albedo result in substantially smaller changes in equilibrium temperature.
        A whopping 1% change in insolation or albedo will cause only <m>1/4</m>% change in temperature.
        The surface temperature of a planet is resistant to change.
        Clearly an increase in insolation will tend to increase the surface temperature of a planet's surface
        (<xref ref="fig_teqsensativity">Figure</xref>, panel A).
        This makes sense:
        more energy received should lead to warming, and vice versa.
        The Sun's output has varied less than 0.1% in recent times (<m>\pm \SI{1}{W/m^2}</m>),
        leading to essentially 0 direct change in Earth's temperature from changes in the Sun's output.
        Higher albedo leads to lower temperatures,
        because more energy is reflected back to space and hence less is available to heat the planet.
        As shown in <xref ref="fig_teqsensativity">Figure</xref>, Panel B, changes in albedo can produce significant changes in temperature,
        which is why Eduardo Gold's painting project had at least a little scientific credence.
        At least twice in Earth's history our planet has plunged into a
        <q>snowball</q>
        state, with glaciers covering the continents and even the oceans almost to sea level,
        even at the equator!
        Ice has a high albedo (0.7 if fresh) and so Earth's surface may have been cold indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calculating the equilibrium surface temperatures of all of the terrestrial planets is both good practice and another instructive way of understanding <xref ref="eq_teq">Equation</xref>.
        A table (Table {tab:teq}) helps to organize the analysis.
        The albedos of Mercury and the Moon are quite low,
        reflecting their lack of atmosphere and dark, basaltic crust.
        Both Mars and Earth have polar ice caps,
        clouds and varied surface types,
        which gives them intermediate albedos.
        Venus's thick layer of clouds,
        consisting of sulfur dioxide and droplets of sulfuric acid , reflect an astonishing 90% of sunlight back to space.
        The high albedo and Venus' proximity to the Sun cause it to shine splendidly in Earth's twilight sky.

      <p>
        The Moon and Earth receive identical insolation,
        but have starkly different albedos.
        The Moon's darker surface and lower albedo means it absorbs 25% more energy from the Sun than Earth does<m>\frac{E_{moon}^{abs}}{E_{earth}^{abs}}=\frac{(1-A_{moon})}{(1-A_{earth})}=\frac{0.89}{0.7}=1.27</m>.
        Accordingly,
        the Moon's <m>T_{eq}</m> is \SI{270}{\kelvin}, about \SI{15}{\kelvin} warmer than Earth's equilibrium temperature.
        Mars and Earth have roughly the same albedos,
        but drastically different insolations.
        Mars receives about half the sunlight Earth does,
        and so its <m>T_{eq}</m> is only \SI{210}{\kelvin}, \SI{45}{\kelvin} less than Earth's and colder than any temperature ever recorded on Earth's surface
        (see Table 3.02).
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>And why is it so wrong?</title>
      <p>
        Let's make a final comparison and see how well our derived equilibrium surface temperatures compare to actual measured surface temperatures.
        Our calculated <m>T_{eq}</m> are identical to measured average surface temperatures for some bodies (Mercury,
        the Moon),
        compare well for others (Mars) and are down-right terrible for the remainder (Earth, Venus).
        Clearly something is wrong:
        the equilibrium temperatures we so laboriously explored don't predict actual surface temperatures of all planets.
        For Earth, the disagreement is significant.
        The calculated <m>T_{eq}</m> is \SI{255}{\kelvin}, or
        <m>-1^{\circ}</m>F. At this temperature, Earth should
        <em>always</em> be a snowball,
        its surface permanently shrouded in a thick layer of snow and ice.
        The actual measured average surface temperature of Earth is \SI{288}{\kelvin}, equivalent to \SI{15}{\degreeCelsius} or a comfortable <m>59^{\circ}</m>F, a whopping
        <m>60^{\circ}</m>F warmer than <m>T_{eq}</m>.
        We haven't wasted our time;
        the equilibrium temperatures we now understand so well are a fundamental part of understanding Earth's climate.
        But it is just that: a part.
        We need to recall observation 3 from above,
        that anything that slows the radiation of heat from a warm object will keep the object warmer, longer.
        Things that can slow the loss of heat include a sweatshirt on a student,
        a blanket on a sleeping person,
        or <em>the atmosphere of a planet</em>.
